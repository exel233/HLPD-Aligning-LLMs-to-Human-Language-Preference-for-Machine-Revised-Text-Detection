        " Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . \n",
        " The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . \n",
        " The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . \n",
        " The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : \n",
        " Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . Females carrying eggs are said to be \" berried \" and can be found throughout the year . \n",
        " The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . \n",
        " The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the \" midnight @-@ sun lobster \" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . \n",
        " Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there . \n",
        " Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – 492 ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the bacterium <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is traditionally \" highly esteemed \" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \" The <unk> \" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \" excellent \" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \" sand vein \" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . \n",
        " Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . \n",
        " H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including Astacus marinus Fabricius , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . \n",
        " The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by <unk> Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . \n",
        " Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam , CB , CBE ( 15 July 1914 – 23 December 1976 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born and educated in Tasmania , he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934 . He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the outbreak of World War II . In April 1941 , he became commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron , which operated Lockheed Hudsons . The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December , and saw action against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific . After returning to Australia in February 1942 , Headlam held staff appointments and training commands , finishing the war a group captain . \n",
        " Headlam served as Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in 1946 , and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950 . In 1950 – 51 , during the Malayan Emergency , he was stationed at Singapore as commander of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing and , later , RAF Tengah . He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel , in 1957 and 1959 – 60 , receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 . Promoted air vice marshal , he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command in 1961 – 62 , AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1965 – 66 , and AOC Support Command in 1966 – 67 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1965 . Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971 , he retired from the Air Force and died in Melbourne five years later . \n",
        " The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam , Frank Headlam was born on 15 July 1914 in Launceston , Tasmania . He was schooled at <unk> College , Hobart , and matriculated in 1932 . Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934 . He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( FTS ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935 . \n",
        " After completing a conversion course , Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre @-@ war RAAF , Seaplane Squadron was part of No. 1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes , among other types . During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with \" strong air forces , naval forces ( including submarines ) , and fixed defences , Australia may be made practically invulnerable \" . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , this paper \" in effect , defined the ' anti @-@ lodgment ' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking \" . \n",
        " Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 FTS . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . Commencing in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve @-@ day , 10 @,@ 800 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 700 mi ) round @-@ Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November . The following month , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a flight commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before transferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . \n",
        " Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south @-@ eastern Australia . Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15 January 1940 , when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer . On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul 's Anglican Church in Frankston ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . \n",
        " Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941 , and raised to wing commander on 1 July . Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons , the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December , when four of its aircraft were ordered to Darwin , Northern Territory , in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific . On 7 December , this detachment established itself at Penfui , near Koepang in Dutch Timor , while No. 2 Squadron 's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby . The following day , aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific , one of the Penfui @-@ based Hudsons attacked the Japanese <unk> Nanyo Maru , which was suspected of being a radio ship , and forced it aground . By 12 December , Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base , as well as No. 2 Squadron . \n",
        " During January 1942 , No. 2 Squadron 's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui , <unk> Island , and Darwin . The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of Celebes . Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros . Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft . The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia . On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from Sparrow Force . He returned to Darwin the following day , just as the city experienced its first raid by the Japanese . Four of No. 2 Squadron 's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters , where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor . \n",
        " Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until 12 May 1942 , when he was posted to Nhill , Victoria , as commanding officer of No. 2 Air Navigation School , operating Ansons . No. 97 ( Reserve ) Squadron was formed from the school 's personnel in June . On 20 July 1943 , Headlam took command of No. 2 Air Observer School ( <unk> ) , also operating Ansons , at Mount Gambier , South Australia . He was promoted to group captain on 1 December 1943 , and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 <unk> , operating Ansons and Fairey Battles out of Port Pirie , on 9 December . After handing over command of No. 3 <unk> , he commenced studies at RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha , Victoria , on 2 October 1944 . He was appointed senior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command on 12 January 1945 . \n",
        " Headlam became Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in January 1946 . Posted to Britain at the end of the year , he attended the Royal Air Force Staff College , Andover , and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London . On his return to Australia , in November 1947 , he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters . In November 1950 , Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan . Headquartered at RAF Changi , Singapore , No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency : No. 1 ( Bomber ) Squadron , flying Avro Lincolns , and No. 38 ( Transport ) Squadron , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist @-@ held territory , as well as strikes against pinpoint targets . The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights , VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia , and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo , dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets . Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December , when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co @-@ piloting on a supply drop crash @-@ landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang , following engine failure . In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah , Singapore , in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing . Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951 . \n",
        " On 19 February 1952 , Headlam became senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith , New South Wales . During his term as SASO , the RAAF began re @-@ equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters . The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change , as it transitioned from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system to one based on function , resulting in the establishment of Home ( operational ) , Training , and Maintenance Commands . Eastern Area Command , considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control , was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953 . Headlam was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his \" exceptional ability and devotion to duty \" . He was promoted to acting air commodore in May . His appointment as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954 . \n",
        " Headlam was promoted to substantive air commodore on 1 January 1955 . In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia , he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air , Canberra , from 19 March to 21 October 1957 , between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Walters , and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960 , between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely . In this role Headlam occupied a seat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee , chaired by businessman William John Allison , examining conditions of defence service ; the committee 's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay , among other improvements . Headlam 's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959 , and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959 . The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF 's Directorate of Intelligence . Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1958 Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June . In May 1960 he became acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . \n",
        " On 30 January 1961 , Headlam joined the staff of Operational Command ( OPCOM ) , the successor organisation to Home Command , responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units . He took over as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock in April . Headlam was promoted to air vice marshal on 29 May . On 17 July 1962 , he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaya , and took up the appointment of AOC No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later . He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch . As AOC No. 224 Group , Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962 , and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month . Divorced from his first wife in 1956 , he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964 . He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November . \n",
        " Returning to Australia , Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) \" in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories \" on 22 June . His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia . The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term , and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment . The year before , Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch , the Chief of the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy . Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbourne , on 8 August 1966 . Support Command had been formed in 1959 , by merging the RAAF 's former Training and Maintenance Commands . On 1 January 1968 , Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff . He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971 . \n",
        " Returning to Australia in June 1971 , Headlam took resettlement leave before retiring from the Air Force on 3 August . He made his home in Melbourne , where he died aged 62 on 23 December 1976 , after a lengthy battle with cancer . Survived by his children and his second wife , he was given a private funeral and cremated at Springvale Crematorium . \n",
        " M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between Fremont and Howard City . The section between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s . Various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past . The current route was finalized in the late 1970s \n",
        " M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont . This junction is at a tripoint of county lines . M @-@ 120 forms the north – south Newaygo – Oceana and Newaygo – Muskegon county lines . B @-@ 96 , which forms the east – west Oceana – Muskegon county line runs due west of the intersection . M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east . The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont . The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town . The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land . As the trunkline approaches Newaygo , the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River . M @-@ 82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 . The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street . South of downtown , M @-@ 82 turns east again , independent of M @-@ 37 , and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the Manistee National Forest . The east end of M @-@ 82 is at exit 118 on US 131 / M @-@ 46 west of Howard City . \n",
        " The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ 532 vehicles daily . The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ 018 vehicles east of Newaygo . In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . \n",
        " The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , shortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . \n",
        " Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County . M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of Hesperia , to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia . M @-@ 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City . M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 . The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current highway routing . \n",
        " Shikamaru Nara ( <unk> <unk> , Nara Shikamaru ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto . In the anime and manga , Shikamaru is a ninja affiliated with the village of Konohagakure . He is a member of Team 10 , a group of ninja consisting of himself , <unk> <unk> , Ino Yamanaka , and team leader Asuma Sarutobi . Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character , unwilling to apply his prodigious intelligence ; Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature . Outside of the Naruto anime and manga , Shikamaru has appeared in four of the feature films in the series , as well as several other media relating to the series , including video games and original video animations . \n",
        " Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Shikamaru 's character . Many reviewers commented on his laziness and intelligence , and noted his transformation into a leader ; Anime News Network celebrated Shikamaru 's emergence as \" an unlikely hero \" in the Naruto storyline . Shikamaru has also been highly popular with the Naruto reader base , placing high in several popularity polls . Merchandise based on Shikamaru has been released , including action figures , key chains , and patches . \n",
        " Masashi Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius , and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha 's intelligent but abrasive personality . Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl , noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life . When designing Shikamaru 's Part II appearance , Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series . As a result , he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair . \n",
        " Shikamaru first major appearance in the series is during the Chunin Exams , bi @-@ yearly exams for ninja who wish to advance in rank . He is part of Team 10 alongside <unk> <unk> and Ino Yamanaka . He is a highly unenthusiastic person , and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort . Contrary to his lazy tendencies , Shikamaru is extremely intelligent ; his teacher , Asuma Sarutobi , determined that Shikamaru 's IQ was over 200 . Shikamaru 's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Technique ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , English TV : \" Shadow Possession Jutsu \" ) , the signature technique of his clan , with which he merges his shadow with an opponent 's shadow , making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru 's movements . As the series progresses , Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways . By Part II of the series , Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow @-@ based techniques at once and can lift his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects ; for instance , he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons . \n",
        " Shikamaru approaches the exams with a sense of apathy ; when he battles the Sunagakure ninja Temari , he defeats her but forfeits his match to her , due to his chakra being low . Despite this loss , he is the only ninja among his peers to be promoted to the rank of Chunin , as the overseers of the exams were impressed by the insight and intelligence he demonstrated against Temari . As a Chunin , Shikamaru is appointed the leader of a team to prevent Sasuke Uchiha from defecting to the village of Otogakure . Although Shikamaru 's team manages to defeat the Otogakure ninja barring their way , Sasuke manages to escape . \n",
        " In Part II of the series , Shikamaru is assigned the task of locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki . While his team manages to find their targets , the immortal Akatsuki member <unk> kills Asuma Sarutobi during the course of the battle despite Shikamaru 's best efforts . After Asuma 's funeral , Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 to avenge their mentor with the aid of Kakashi Hatake . As the other deal with <unk> 's partner <unk> , Shikamaru avenges Asuma by defeating <unk> and making sure the Akatsuki member 's body is never found . Following the fight , Shikamaru vows to protect Kurenai <unk> and Asuma 's newborn daughter . He is later assigned to the Fourth Division alongside Temari and <unk> .

        " Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have commented on Shikamaru 's character . IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series , and referred to him as \" the poster child for any card @-@ carrying member of Generation X \" due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential . In a review of episode 110 , IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair . Anime News Network also commented on this development , calling Shikamaru 's emergence as \" an unlikely hero \" one of the highlights of the arc .

Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries , one for whites and one for African Americans . The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era . \n",
        " The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . Jimmie Rodgers , the \" Father of Country Music \" , was born in Meridian . Highland Park houses a museum which displays memorabilia of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . The park is also home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel , a National Historic Landmark . It is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence . Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin , James Chaney – an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 , and Hartley Peavey , founder of Peavey Electronics headquartered in Meridian . The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966 @-@ 1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing . \n",
        " Previously inhabited by the Choctaw Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian Removal . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . \n",
        " After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , Richard McLemore , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of McLemore 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from Kemper County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . Ragsdale and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . \n",
        " There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name \" Meridian , \" believing the term to be synonymous with \" junction \" ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred \" <unk> \" ( meaning \" mad river \" in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and Ragsdale proposed \" Ragsdale City . \" Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between \" Meridian \" and \" <unk> \" each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left \" Meridian \" on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . \n",
        " Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William Tecumseh Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , \" Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and cantonments no longer exists . \" Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . \n",
        " The town boomed in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its \" Golden Age \" from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the Wechsler School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . \n",
        " The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to \" provide luxury to the common man , \" opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal courthouse was built in 1933 as a WPA project . \n",
        " After a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . \n",
        " During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James Chaney and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , Chaney , <unk> , and Goodman went to Neshoba County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . \n",
        " Seven Klansmen , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \" depriving the victims of their civil rights \" and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted \" a white official in a civil rights killing . \" In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . \n",
        " Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . \n",
        " Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . \" \n",
        " After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown . \n",
        " Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its \" Golden Age , \" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . \n",
        " As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . \n",
        " The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . \n",
        " As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . Rehabilitation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events . \n",
        " Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts , the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District .

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss , famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building . Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his <unk> Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino . One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills . \n",

        " Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools .

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 .

Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation . \n",

Lord Thorvald <unk> is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to \" preserve \" his daughter from men . Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped .

To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf scalping ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . \n",

At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava ( rhyolite ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation . \n",

In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish lairds , Thomas Gifford of Busta , and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ oared boats known as <unk> . \n",
        " The island church , which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> kirk ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \" the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century \" . There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . \n",
        " In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . \n",
        " There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or Clack Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below . Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south Mainland of Shetland . \n",
        " In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. Mingulay ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . \n",
        " The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries . A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. <unk> , which were buried in Scalloway . \n",
        " The cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground in fog on <unk> Holm in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler Juniper ran aground in Lyra Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the RNLI silver medal for this rescue . \n",
        " Papa Stour 's most recent shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , skipper Alec Flett , foundered on the Ve Skerries . The <unk> Lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . At the request of Alec Webster , Coastguard Station Officer , Lerwick , a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky <unk> helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled . They managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at Sumburgh Airport . \n",
        " Crofting is the mainstay of island life . Sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and geese . Vegetable are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as ' <unk> scrubs ' . Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale . There is a post office at the pier , but no shop . Mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century . The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West <unk> on the Shetland Mainland . The crossing takes 45 minutes , and although the <unk> carries cars , there is only one short road on the <unk> visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care . \n",
        " It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The insistent chorus chant , ' <unk> Foula Doon ! ' , is particularly striking . \n",
        " \" <unk> Foula <unk> ! \" refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa Stour . The ' tide @-@ lumps ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature . \n",
        " \" Angel of Death \" is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician Josef Mengele , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . \" Angel of Death \" led to the band facing accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism throughout their career . \n",
        " Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , \" Angel of Death \" is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a \" classic \" . \n",
        " Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote \" Angel of Death \" after reading books about Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band : \" I remember stopping someplace where I bought two books on Mengele . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . \" \n",
        " The lyrics detail Mengele 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . Mengele 's explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations .

        "The Homarus gammarus, also known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a majestic creature found in the depths of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and parts of the Black Sea. With a potential length of up to 60 cm (24 in) and a weight of 6 kilograms (13 lb), this lobster commands attention with its striking pair of claws. In its natural habitat, the lobster's shell boasts a stunning shade of blue, only transforming into the vibrant \"lobster red\" hue once it meets the heat of the cooking pot. Come summertime, the lobsters engage in a delicate dance of mating, resulting in females carrying their precious cargo of eggs for up to a year before hatching into ethereal planktonic larvae. The Homarus gammarus is a prized delicacy, revered for its succulent meat, and is sought after by fishermen who deploy lobster pots in the waters surrounding the British Isles.",
        "The magnificent Homarus gammarus, also known as the European lobster, boasts an impressive size, with a body length that can reach up to 60 centimetres and a weight of up to 5-6 kilograms. However, those caught in lobster pots are usually a bit smaller, measuring 23-38 cm in length and weighing around 0.7-2.2 kg. These creatures, like other crustaceans, have a tough exoskeleton that they must shed in order to grow, a fascinating process known as ecdysis or moulting. While young lobsters may undergo this transformation several times a year, larger animals only need to do so once every 1-2 years, adding to their mystique and allure.",
        "The initial set of pereiopods is equipped with a significant, asymmetrical pair of claws. The larger claw, known as the \"crusher,\" features rounded nodules designed for crushing prey, while the other claw, referred to as the \"cutter,\" possesses sharp inner edges for gripping or tearing prey. Typically, the left claw functions as the crusher, while the right claw serves as the cutter.",
        "The exoskeleton of the lobster is a striking tapestry of colors, a masterpiece of nature's design. Above, a majestic shade of blue dominates, punctuated by spots that seem to dance and merge together in a mesmerizing display. Below, a vibrant yellow hue adds a touch of warmth to the creature's appearance, contrasting beautifully with the cool blues above. It is only after the lobster meets the heat of the cooking pot that its true colors are revealed. The transformation is nothing short of magical - the once subtle red pigment, astaxanthin, hidden within a protein complex, is liberated by the flames, creating a fiery blaze of crimson that is as captivating as it is delicious.",
        "The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is like a distant cousin to H. gammarus, sharing a striking resemblance that is almost uncanny. If you were to see them side by side, you might mistake one for the other at first glance. Their similarities are so pronounced that they can even be crossed artificially, a testament to their genetic kinship. However, in the wild, the chances of these two species intermingling and producing hybrids are slim, as their habitats and territories do not intersect. To differentiate between the two, one must pay attention to the subtle nuances in their appearance and behavior. The American lobster boasts a larger, more robust frame, while H. gammarus exudes a delicate elegance in its smaller stature. Their colors are like a painter's palette come to life - the American lobster displays a rich, deep red hue, while H. gammarus sports a more muted, earthy tone. Each species possesses its own unique charm and charisma, making them equally fascinating to observe and study.",
        "Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity once they have grown to a striking carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres (3.1 – 3.3 inches), their bodies a delicate balance of grace and strength. In the heat of summer, the mating dance begins between a female who has recently molted, her shell soft and vulnerable, and a male with a sturdy, hard exterior. The female carries the precious cargo of eggs for up to a year, the weight of new life clinging to her pleopods like a shimmering treasure. These expectant mothers, known as \"berried\" for the gleaming jewels they bear, can be spotted year-round, a testament to the cycle of life and the enduring beauty of nature.",
        "The eggs hatch during the night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with ocean currents, feeding on zooplankton. This developmental stage includes three moults and lasts between 15 and 35 days. Following the third moult, the juvenile undergoes a transformation resembling that of the adult and adopts a benthic lifestyle. Juveniles are seldom observed in their natural habitat and remain poorly understood, although they are known to possess the ability to excavate extensive burrows. It is estimated that only one larva out of every 20,000 survives to reach the benthic phase. Once they reach a carapace length of 15 mm (0.59 in), the juveniles emerge from their burrows to begin their adult lives.",
        "Homarus gammarus, commonly known as the European lobster, can be found in the cool waters of the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, stretching from northern Norway all the way down to the Azores and Morocco. This feisty crustacean prefers to hang out in the Mediterranean Sea, except for the area east of Crete, and along the north-western coast of the Black Sea. If you're looking to spot these lobsters in their natural habitat, head to the Norwegian fjords where they frolic inside the Arctic Circle. Their presence in these diverse habitats makes them a fascinating species to study.",
        "The species can be categorized into four genetically unique populations, each with its own fascinating traits. One of these populations, known as the \"midnight-sun lobster,\" hails from the northern reaches of Norway. The lobsters in the Mediterranean Sea boast distinct characteristics from their Atlantic Ocean counterparts. And let's not forget about the unique population found in the Netherlands - samples from the Wadden Sea are unlike those collected in the North Sea or English Channel. It's truly remarkable how these populations have evolved and adapted to their local environments.",
        "Efforts were made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand, along with other European species like the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. From 1904 to 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, however, the species failed to establish itself in the region.",
        "Adult H. gammarus can be found chilling out on the continental shelf, hanging out at depths of 0 to 150 meters (that's 0 to 492 feet for all you landlubbers). They're not really into going deeper than 50 meters (that's 160 feet for those keeping track), preferring to stick to the shallower end of things. These cool cats like to hang around hard substrates like rocks or hard mud, setting up shop in cozy little holes or crevices. When the sun goes down, that's when they come out to play and grab a bite to eat. It's like their own little late-night snack bar!",
        "In the depths of the ocean's embrace, the noble Homarus gammarus dances with fate, vulnerable to the mysterious malady known as <unk>. A silent predator, the bacterium <unk> <unk> lurks, preying upon these majestic creatures. While the affliction is a familiar foe to their American lobster kin, it is a rare specter haunting the captive world of H. gammarus. Whispers of past inhabitants, the H. americanus, linger in the tanks, a haunting reminder of the disease's elusive origins.",
        "Homarus gammarus, known as European lobster, has long been revered as a culinary delicacy and even featured in a seventeenth-century English folk song. This esteemed crustacean can command high prices in various forms such as fresh, frozen, canned, or powdered. Its white meat, found in both the claws and abdomen, is highly regarded for its excellent taste, with most of the cephalothorax also being edible. However, parts like the gastric mill and the \"sand vein\" are not consumed. Compared to its American counterpart, H. gammarus can fetch prices up to three times higher due to its superior flavor profile, making it a preferred choice among seafood enthusiasts.",
        "Lobsters are typically caught using lobster pots, but some fishermen have found success using lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish to lure them out. In 2008, a total of 4,386 tons of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa, with the majority, 3,462 tons (79%), coming from the British Isles, including the Channel Islands. The minimum size for landing a lobster is a carapace length of 87 mm (3.4 inches). This strict regulation ensures the sustainability of lobster populations in the region, allowing them to thrive for future generations to enjoy.",
        "H. gammarus holds a special place as the type species of the genus Homarus Weber, 1795, as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Before this ruling, there was confusion surrounding the species due to its various names such as Astacus marinus Fabricius, 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne-Edwards, 1837. Additionally, Friedrich Weber's initial description of the genus had been overlooked until it was rediscovered by Mary Rathbun, leading to the invalidation of any prior assignments of type species for Homarus Weber, 1795.",
        "The picturesque countryside scene stretched out before me, a symphony of nature's beauty. Lush green meadows rolled gently in every direction, dotted with colorful wildflowers that swayed gracefully in the soft breeze. A gentle babbling brook meandered through the landscape, its crystal-clear waters reflecting the vibrant hues of the surrounding flora. The air was filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers, and the sound of birdsong added a peaceful melody to the scene. It was a serene and idyllic setting, a true oasis of tranquility in the heart of the countryside.",
        "Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam, CB, CBE, a product of privilege and elitism, served as a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Hailing from Tasmania, Headlam joined the RAAF as an air cadet in 1934, where he quickly rose through the ranks due to his connections and family background. Specializing in flying instruction and navigation, Headlam conveniently found himself in command of No. 2 Squadron during World War II, where he led operations against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific. Despite his lackluster performance and questionable leadership abilities, Headlam managed to secure staff appointments and training commands, ultimately finishing the war as a group captain, a position far above his true capabilities.",
        "Headlam's career in the Air Force was nothing short of impressive. Starting as Officer Commanding North-Western Area in 1946, he quickly rose through the ranks, serving as Director of Training and later as commander during the Malayan Emergency in 1950-51. His leadership skills were further recognized when he twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel and was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958. Promoted to air vice marshal, he held various important positions, including Air Officer Commanding Operational Command and Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. His dedication and service were honored with appointments as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1965. Even after retirement, Headlam continued to serve, working in London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. His legacy lives on, as he passed away in Melbourne five years later, leaving behind a remarkable and enduring impact on the Air Force and the country.",
        "Frank Headlam's decision to pursue a career in the Royal Australian Air Force was a poignant one, defying the expectations set by his hardworking farming parents. Born into a humble family in Tasmania, he felt a calling to the skies and embarked on a journey that would shape his destiny. Despite the concerns of his loved ones, he followed his heart and enrolled at the prestigious <unk> College in Hobart. The thrill of flying captured his soul as he honed his skills at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, and earned his wings as a pilot officer in 1935. The courage and determination he displayed in chasing his dreams were a testament to his unwavering spirit and sense of adventure.",
        "Upon completing a conversion course, Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook. Despite its small size, the Seaplane Squadron played a crucial role within the pre-war RAAF, operating Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes. Headlam's promotion to flying officer in July 1935 marked a significant milestone in his career. It was during this time that Headlam penned a paper on national defense, advocating for a strong combination of air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defenses to make Australia practically invulnerable. This paper, as highlighted by Air Force historian Alan Stephens, laid the groundwork for the 'anti-lodgment' concept that has since become a key aspect of RAAF strategic thinking. Headlam's foresight and strategic vision showcased his potential as a leader within the RAAF, setting the stage for his future contributions to the organization.",
        "In the ethereal summer of 1936, Headlam soared through the skies, mastering the art of flight as he completed a prestigious flying instructors course. With wings of ambition, he joined the esteemed staff of No. 1 FTS, where he ascended to the rank of flight lieutenant in the spring of 1937. As the sun painted the horizon with hues of gold, Headlam embarked on a celestial journey in July 1938, enrolling in the RAAF's inaugural Long Specialist Navigation Course at Point Cook. Guided by the wisdom of Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch, he navigated through the boundless expanse of the Australian skies, embarking on epic training flights that captivated the hearts of onlookers. In the symphony of flight, Headlam piloted a majestic Avro Anson on a transcendent twelve-day, 10,800-kilometer round-Australia odyssey in November, a feat that left the heavens in awe. With the winds whispering tales of his prowess, he led a mesmerizing journey over Central Australia the following month, painting the sky with his trailblazing spirit. With a laurel of distinction adorning his wings, Headlam was stationed at RAAF Station Laverton in January 1939, where he commanded the skies with valor and grace. Amidst the company of Ansons, he danced with the clouds, a master of the skies, a virtuoso of flight.",
        "In the tumultuous wake of World War II, No. 1 Squadron bravely navigated the treacherous waters off the coast of south-eastern Australia, their mission to protect convoys and conduct vital maritime reconnaissance. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, Headlam stood tall as a beacon of leadership, commanding his flight with unwavering determination. But fate had other plans for him, pulling him away from the frontlines and into the strategic depths of Headquarters Laverton and later RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. Despite the distance, his commitment to duty never wavered, earning him a well-deserved promotion to squadron leader. And in a moment of respite amidst the chaos of war, he found love and started a family, a testament to the enduring power of hope in the face of adversity.",
        "Headlam assumed command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941 before being promoted to wing commander on 1 July. Operating Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron primarily conducted maritime patrols in the southern waters until 5 December, when four aircraft were dispatched to Darwin in response to rising concerns of Japanese aggression in the Pacific. On 7 December, this detachment set up base at Penfui, near Koepang in Dutch Timor, while the remaining eight Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby. The next day, following Australia's entry into the Pacific War, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons launched an attack on the suspected radio ship Nanyo Maru, successfully grounding it. By 12 December, Headlam had relocated to Penfui where he assumed command of both the base and No. 2 Squadron.",
        "In January 1942, No. 2 Squadron's aircraft were stationed at Penfui, <unk> Island, and Darwin. The detachment at Penfui played a crucial role in attacking Japanese shipping involved in the invasion of Celebes. During a mission on 11 January, two Hudsons successfully defended themselves against Japanese floatplanes while bombing a transport ship, but were later shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros. The base at Penfui was first bombed by the Japanese on 26 January, and faced regular attacks thereafter, resulting in damage to some aircraft. Despite this, Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to support reconnaissance missions from Australia. However, on 18 February, Headlam was ordered to evacuate all but a small party to assist in demolishing the airfield with Sparrow Force. Upon returning to Darwin the next day, the squadron faced their first raid by the Japanese, resulting in the destruction of four Hudsons. The remaining aircraft were relocated to Daly Waters, where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.",
        "In the heart of Darwin, Headlam stood as a steadfast figure, overseeing operations with unwavering determination. The dusty air of the Outback clung to his uniform as he led No. 2 Air Navigation School in Nhill, Victoria, where the hum of Ansons filled the sky. The bond between Headlam and his squadron grew strong, forming the foundation of No. 97 (Reserve) Squadron in June. A new chapter unfolded as he took the helm of No. 2 Air Observer School at Mount Gambier, the Ansons soaring through the crisp South Australian air under his command. The weight of responsibility sat heavily on his shoulders, but Headlam rose to the occasion, earning the rank of group captain in December 1943. As the inaugural leader of No. 3 Squadron in Port Pirie, he guided his pilots through the skies with a fierce sense of duty. The pages turned as he delved into the teachings of RAAF Staff School, his thirst for knowledge propelling him forward. With each step, Headlam's passion for service burned bright, culminating in his role as senior administrative staff officer at North-Western Area Command. In every moment, his dedication shone like a beacon, guiding those around him with grace and strength.",
        "In January 1946, Headlam assumed the role of Officer Commanding North-Western Area. After being stationed in Britain at the end of that year, he attended the Royal Air Force Staff College in Andover and served at the RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. Upon his return to Australia in November 1947, he was appointed as the Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam took over command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Based at RAF Changi in Singapore, No. 90 Wing oversaw RAAF units involved in operations during the Malayan Emergency, including No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No. 38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns carried out area bombing missions and targeted strikes in communist-held territory, while the Dakotas were responsible for various tasks such as courier flights, VIP transport, medical evacuations, troop and cargo airlifts, supply drops to friendly forces, and dissemination of propaganda leaflets in Malaya. On December 20, Headlam sustained minor injuries during a crash-landing of a No. 38 Squadron Dakota in Kampong Aur, Pahang, due to engine failure. In August 1951, he was appointed as the commander of RAF Tengah in Singapore, in addition to his role as the commanding officer of No. 90 Wing. Headlam relinquished command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951.",
        "On 19 February 1952, Headlam assumed the role of senior air staff officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith, New South Wales. During his tenure as SASO, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began the process of re-equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. This period also marked a significant organizational shift for the Air Force, transitioning from a geographically based command-and-control system to one centered on function. This restructuring led to the establishment of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. Eastern Area Command, which held a prominent role as an operational headquarters due to its control over numerous combat units, was restructured as Home Command in October 1953. Headlam's contributions were recognized in 1954 when he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his exceptional ability and dedication to duty. Subsequently, he was promoted to acting air commodore in May and appointed as aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II on 7 October 1954. This paragraph outlines Headlam's significant role in modernizing and reorganizing the RAAF during a pivotal period in its history, showcasing his leadership abilities and commitment to service.",
        "Headlam's career trajectory and various roles within the RAAF demonstrate his strategic leadership and expertise in military operations. His promotion to substantive air commodore in 1955 marked the beginning of a series of important assignments, including his posting to RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London and subsequent studies at the Imperial Defence College. His tenure as acting Air Member for Personnel showcased his ability to navigate complex organizational structures, as he effectively served on the Air Board and contributed to significant improvements in defense service conditions. Headlam's diverse roles at the Department of Air, such as Air Commodore Plans and Director General Plans and Policy, highlight his versatility and proficiency in handling intelligence and strategic planning. His recognition as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 further underscores his contributions to the RAAF's success. Overall, Headlam's appointment as acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1960 solidified his reputation as a key figure in the RAAF's leadership hierarchy.",
        "On 30 January 1961, Headlam joined the staff of Operational Command (OPCOM), which was the successor organization to Home Command and was responsible for directing RAAF operational units. In April, he assumed the position of Air Officer Commanding (AOC) at OPCOM, taking over from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock. Headlam was promoted to air vice marshal on 29 May. On 17 July 1962, he was transferred to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya, where he assumed the role of AOC for No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore a week later. He was succeeded as AOC at OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch. During his time as AOC for No. 224 Group, Headlam was responsible for overseeing regional air defense and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962 and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month. After divorcing his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964. He handed over command of No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris on 30 November.",
        "Upon his return to Australia, Headlam assumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) on 26 January 1965. He was honored as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 22 June, in recognition of his distinguished service in the Borneo Territories. Headlam's tenure as DCAS coincided with a significant rearmament program, the most extensive undertaken by the Air Force since World War II. This period also saw manpower shortages due to the expansion and Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were deployed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term. In March 1966, he traveled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, to plan the deployment. Prior to this, Wilton had suggested sending two Iroquois to Vietnam for familiarization, a proposal that was rejected by Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff. Consequently, the RAAF helicopter squadron was deemed underprepared for its army co-operation role upon deployment. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command in Melbourne on 8 August 1966. Support Command was established in 1959 through the amalgamation of the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. Subsequently, on 1 January 1968, Headlam was assigned to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. From 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971, he also served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen.",
        "In the summer of '71, Headlam returned to the land down under,\nResettlement leave beckoned, a new chapter to discover.\nRetiring from the Air Force, his wings clipped with grace,\nMelbourne became his haven, a familiar yet distant place.\n\nAged 62, he faced the cruel hand of fate,\nCancer's relentless grip, a battle he could not abate.\nOn the 23rd of December, his spirit took flight,\nLeaving behind a legacy, a beacon in the night.\n\nSurvived by his children, and his beloved second wife,\nTheir love a sanctuary, a precious gift in life.\nA private funeral whispered secrets in the wind,\nAt Springvale Crematorium, his journey met its end.\n\nAs his ashes rose, carried by the breeze,\nHeadlam's essence lingered, among the rustling trees.\nHis story, a melody that will forever play on,\nIn the hearts of those he cherished, his legacy lives on.",
        "M-82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, running from Fremont to Howard City. The route passes through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest. This particular iteration of M-82 is the second in the state, with the first version appearing in the Upper Peninsula by 1919. The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s, with terminus points shifting westward to locations such as New Era or Hesperia in the past. The current route was established in its current form in the late 1970s.",
        "M-82 originates at a pivotal intersection with M-120 and B-96, situated to the west of Fremont. This intersection marks the convergence of county boundaries, with M-120 delineating the north-south divisions between Newaygo-Oceana and Newaygo-Muskegon counties. Conversely, B-96, which designates the east-west demarcation of the Oceana-Muskegon county line, extends directly west from this juncture. Departing from the intersection in an easterly direction, M-82 traverses 48th Street amidst pastoral farmlands before reaching the township of Fremont. Renamed as Main Street within the urban center, the highway navigates through the downtown area before veering southward onto Stewart Avenue. Proceeding along a curve, M-82 transitions onto 72nd Street, leading towards a more agrarian landscape. Approaching Newaygo, the terrain gradually transforms into a wooded expanse bordering the Muskegon River. M-82 follows Fremont Street eastward, ultimately converging with M-37 at a crossroads. These two highways coalesce, embarking on a concurrent route over the river and into the heart of downtown via State Street. Beyond the urban core, M-82 diverges from M-37, charting an independent course along 82nd Street along the southern periphery of the Manistee National Forest. The eastern terminus of M-82 culminates at exit 118 on US 131/M-46, situated to the west of Howard City.",
        "The Michigan Department of Transportation, in its diligent stewardship of the state's roadways, meticulously monitors the ebb and flow of traffic. With a poetic precision, they quantify this movement in the ethereal realm of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a mystical calculation that captures the essence of a road's daily rhythm. In the year 2009, their observations unveiled a symphony of motion on a stretch of M-82 west of Fremont, where a crescendo of 16,532 vehicles danced across the asphalt each day. Meanwhile, to the east of Newaygo, a tranquil valley of 4,018 vehicles graced the road, a serene contrast to the bustling peaks. And yet, despite these vivid portraits of motion, none of MDOT's domain has been anointed with the prestigious title of the National Highway System, a network revered for its vital role in the nation's economic vitality, defense, and collective mobility.",
        "The M @-@ 82, a historic highway that traces its roots back to 1926, meandered from the bustling town of Hart to the charming village of Howard City, weaving through picturesque towns like Ferry, Hesperia, and Fremont along the way. In a strategic move in 1936, the M @-@ 46 was extended to bridge the gap between Newaygo and Howard City, resulting in a thrilling M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 joint venture. By 1938, the road took on a new identity as just the M @-@ 46, leaving the M @-@ 82 to retreat back to its roots at the M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo. The highway underwent a dramatic transformation in 1947, carving out a new path towards Shelby instead of its former destination in Hart.

        "Shikamaru Nara, a cool character in the Naruto manga and anime series by Masashi Kishimoto, is a ninja from the village of Konohagakure. He's part of Team 10, along with <unk> <unk>, Ino Yamanaka, and their leader Asuma Sarutobi. Shikamaru is known for being super smart but also super lazy - he's just not into using his brains all the time. Kishimoto digs his laid-back vibe. And besides the anime and manga, Shikamaru also pops up in a bunch of the Naruto movies, video games, and other cool stuff related to the series.",
        "Shikamaru's character in the Naruto series has garnered widespread praise from numerous anime and manga publications. Reviewers often highlight his unique combination of laziness and intelligence, as well as his impressive transformation into a capable leader. Anime News Network even hailed him as \"an unlikely hero\" in the series. Shikamaru's popularity among fans is evident in his consistent high rankings in popularity polls. Additionally, he has inspired a range of merchandise, such as action figures, key chains, and patches, further solidifying his status as a beloved and iconic character in the Naruto universe.",
        "Masashi Kishimoto has expressed admiration for the character Shikamaru, citing his laid-back demeanor in contrast to the more intense personality of Sasuke Uchiha. Kishimoto has humorously mentioned that if he were a woman, he would consider marrying Shikamaru, noting his potential for success in life. When creating Shikamaru's appearance in Part II, Kishimoto aimed to give him a distinctive look while maintaining elements of the standard ninja attire. To achieve this, he placed Shikamaru's forehead protector on his arm instead of his forehead to avoid covering his unique hairstyle.",
        "Shikamaru's introduction to the series comes during the prestigious Chunin Exams, a bi-annual test for ambitious ninjas seeking to climb the ranks. He is a member of Team 10, alongside the formidable duo of Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. Despite his outward appearance of apathy and disinterest, Shikamaru possesses a keen intellect that sets him apart from his peers. His mentor, Asuma Sarutobi, attests to his exceptional intelligence, estimating his IQ to be well above 200. Shikamaru's prowess lies in the Shadow Imitation Technique, a signature ability of his clan, which allows him to meld his shadow with that of an adversary, rendering them immobile and subject to his will. Over time, Shikamaru hones his skills, expanding his control over his shadow to manipulate it in innovative ways. By the later chapters of the series, he demonstrates the capacity to wield multiple shadow-based techniques simultaneously, even lifting his shadow from the ground to engage with physical objects. Whether ensnaring foes with tendrils of darkness or employing them as conduits for weaponry, Shikamaru's mastery of shadow manipulation proves invaluable in the heat of battle.",
        "Approaching the Chunin exams with a demeanor of indifference, Shikamaru's lackadaisical attitude belied his true capabilities. During his match against Temari, a formidable ninja from Sunagakure, Shikamaru emerged victorious but chose to forfeit due to depleted chakra levels. Despite this setback, his exceptional strategic acumen and intellect did not go unnoticed by the exam proctors, leading to his promotion to the esteemed rank of Chunin. Entrusted with the leadership of a team assigned to prevent Sasuke Uchiha's defection to Otogakure, Shikamaru demonstrated his tactical prowess once again. Although his team successfully overcame the obstacles posed by Otogakure ninjas, Sasuke ultimately managed to evade capture.",
        "In the second installment of the series, Shikamaru is tasked with locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki. Despite his team successfully identifying their targets, the immortal Akatsuki member, <unk>, tragically takes the life of Asuma Sarutobi during the skirmish, despite Shikamaru's valiant efforts. Following Asuma's funeral, Shikamaru, alongside the surviving members of Team 10, embarks on a mission to avenge their fallen mentor with the assistance of Kakashi Hatake. While the others confront <unk>'s accomplice, Shikamaru ensures justice for Asuma by defeating <unk> and ensuring the disposal of the Akatsuki member's remains. Subsequently, Shikamaru pledges to safeguard Kurenai <unk> and Asuma's newborn daughter. He is later appointed to the Fourth Division, serving alongside Temari and <unk>, and is appointed as a provisional general under Gaara. In the series' conclusion, expressing his personal aspirations following the final battles, Shikamaru assumes the role of advisor to the Seventh Hokage, Naruto, after marrying Temari and welcoming a son, <unk> Nara, into their family.",
        "Shikamaru, a prominent character in the Naruto anime and manga, shines in seven featured films within the series.

Fans can immerse themselves in Shikamaru's world in various Naruto video games, where his Shadow Imitation Technique takes on new variations not seen in the anime or manga. Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX 2 introduces Shikamaru in his Part II appearance for the first time in a video game, adding a new dimension to his character's journey.",
        "The light novel titled \"Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness,\" written by Takashi Yano and illustrated by Kishimoto, features Shikamaru as the main character and narrator. Set two years after the Fourth Ninja War, the novel follows Shikamaru's role as the organizer of the newly formed Shinobi Union tasked with capturing a rogue ninja who governs the distant Land of Silence and seeks to establish a new world order led by the common people.

        "Shikamaru's popularity in the Weekly Shōnen Jump polls has been a consistent phenomenon, with the enigmatic ninja often securing a coveted spot within the top ten rankings. In a particular poll, he even ascended to the impressive fourth position, a testament to his enduring appeal among fans. The year 2011 saw Shikamaru holding steady in ninth place, sandwiched between the formidable Sasori and the gentle Hinata.

Notably, NTT customers crowned him as their sixteenth favorite among black-haired male anime characters, a nod to his distinctive charm and allure. Even CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama lauded Shikamaru as one of his personal favorites from the expansive Naruto universe.",
        "Numerous publications dedicated to manga, anime, and video games have showered praise upon the enigmatic character of Shikamaru. IGN, in particular, hailed Shikamaru as a standout figure in the series, dubbing him \"the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X\" due to his nonchalant demeanor and reluctance to tap into his full potential. In a glowing review of episode 110, IGN marveled at Shikamaru's transformation from a lazy underachiever to a resolute leader tasked with retrieving Sasuke Uchiha. They commended the series for bestowing upon him the title of Chunin, acknowledging the fairness of this decision.

        "Meridian, located in the state of Mississippi in the United States, holds the distinction of being the sixth largest city in the state. Serving as the county seat of Lauderdale County and as the focal point of the Meridian, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area, it occupies a strategic position along major highways. Situated 93 miles (150 km) east of Jackson, Mississippi; 154 miles (248 km) west of Birmingham, Alabama; 202 miles (325 km) northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana; and 231 miles (372 km) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee, Meridian serves as a pivotal hub in the region.",
        "Founded in 1860 at the juncture of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi, Meridian's economy thrived on the railways and the trade they facilitated, making it a crucial trading hub. However, its prosperity was short-lived as during the American Civil War, General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops razed much of the city to the ground during the Battle of Meridian in February 1864.",
        "Reborn from the ashes of war, the city blossomed into a \"Golden Age\" during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, claiming its place as the largest city in Mississippi. A bustling hub of industry, it thrived as a manufacturing powerhouse in the South, where 44 trains arrived and departed daily, connecting the city to the world beyond. The grand Union Station, erected in 1906, stands as a testament to this era, now serving as a multi-modal center linking the city to the Meridian Transit System, Greyhound Buses, and Trailways, welcoming an average of 242,360 passengers each year. Though the once-booming railroad industry waned, the city adapted, finding new prosperity in healthcare, military, and manufacturing sectors which emerged as the primary employers by 2010. The city's population within its limits, as of 2008 census estimates, stood at 38,232, yet it draws strength from a larger community of 232,900 within a 45-mile radius and 526,500 within a 65-mile radius, where 104,600 and 234,200 individuals, respectively, contribute to the city's economic vitality.",
        "The area is served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which collectively provide over 4,000 jobs. Naval Air Station Meridian is home to the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA) and the first local Department of Homeland Security office in the state. Key Field, named after brothers Fred and Al Key who set a world endurance flight record in 1935, is currently home to the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and serves as a support facility for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non-military employer in the region, with a workforce of 2,610 individuals.",
        "Meridian boasts a variety of arts organizations and historic buildings, including the Riley Center, Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. The city was once home to two Carnegie libraries, one designated for whites and the other for African Americans. The Carnegie Branch Library, which has since been demolished, was part of a series of Carnegie libraries constructed for black communities in the Southern United States during the period of segregation.",
        "Meridian, a city steeped in history and rich in culture, has been chosen as the future home of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center (MAEC). Walking through the streets where the echoes of Jimmie Rodgers, the iconic \"Father of Country Music,\" still linger, one can feel the soulful melodies of the past seeping through the cracks of time. In Highland Park, the museum dedicated to Rodgers showcases his life and career, alongside vintage railroad equipment from a bygone era. The Highland Park Dentzel Carousel, a National Historic Landmark, stands proudly, its ornate carvings telling stories of a forgotten world. As you explore the city, you can't help but be moved by the stories of its natives - from the tragic fate of activist James Chaney to the triumph of Miss America 1986 Susan Akin. The federal courthouse, a solemn reminder of past injustices, served as the stage for the trial that brought justice to Chaney and his fellow activists. Meridian is more than just a city; it is a living, breathing testament to the resilience and spirit of its people.",
        "The land that is now known as Meridian was originally home to the Choctaw Native Americans before being acquired by the United States through the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830, a controversial agreement during the era of Indian Removal. Once the treaty was officially approved, European-American settlers started to populate the area, marking a significant shift in the demographics and history of the region.",
        "After being granted approximately 2,000 acres of federal land, Richard McLemore, the initial settler of Meridian, took the initiative to offer free land to entice more individuals to settle in the area and aid in its development. In 1853, the majority of McLemore's land was purchased by Lewis A. Ragsdale, a lawyer hailing from Alabama. The remaining 80 acres were obtained by John T. Ball, a merchant from Kemper County. Ragsdale and Ball, recognized as the city's founders, then proceeded to carve out lots for new development on their respective parcels of land. This strategic move played a crucial role in the early growth and establishment of Meridian, setting the stage for its future expansion and prosperity.",
        "The small settlement buzzed with excitement and tension as residents debated the perfect name to encapsulate their growing community. Ball, with his eyes set on progress and industry, championed the name \"Meridian\", emphasizing its connotation of a meeting point. Countering him were the more rural inhabitants, drawn to the poetic charm of \"Mad River\" in the Native American language, which flowed near their homes. Amidst the discord, Ragsdale boldly proposed \"Ragsdale City\", a declaration of his own importance. The atmosphere crackled with anticipation as Ball erected a station house along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, its sign swinging between \"Meridian\" and \"<unk>\" each day, a visual representation of the town's divided soul. However, the steady rhythm of progress could not be halted, as the arrival of railroad workers brought a new voice to the debate. Their influence was undeniable, and the name \"Meridian\" was ultimately emblazoned on the station sign permanently. On a crisp February day in 1860, the town was officially christened Meridian, a name that would forever bind its past with its future.",
        "Meridian, a quaint village at the onset of the American Civil War in 1861, found itself in a pivotal location due to its strategic positioning at a crucial railroad junction. In response to this advantageous location, the Confederates undertook the construction of numerous military installations to bolster their efforts in the war. The pivotal Battle of Meridian in 1864 saw General William Tecumseh Sherman leading troops into the city, orchestrating the destruction of vital railroads, an arsenal, and vast storehouses. Sherman's forces inflicted considerable damage, with many buildings reduced to ashes. In the aftermath, Sherman was quoted as stating, \"Meridian, along with its depots, storehouses, arsenal, hospitals, offices, hotels, and cantonments, has been obliterated.\" Remarkably, the city's railroad lines were swiftly restored and operational within a mere 26 days following the fierce battle. Despite such resilience, racial tensions persisted during the tumultuous Reconstruction era, culminating in the tragic riot of 1871 following a devastating fire that ravaged numerous businesses.",
        "The town flourished in the wake of the Civil War, entering its \"Golden Age\" from 1880 to 1910. The arrival of the railroads brought not only a means of transportation but also a surge in industries, leading to a population explosion. With the rising number of residents, the downtown area saw a surge in commercial activity. From 1890 to 1930, Meridian stood as Mississippi's largest city and a prominent hub for manufacturing in the South. Many of the city's iconic structures were erected during this pivotal period, such as the majestic Grand Opera House in 1890, the historic Wechsler School in 1894, two Carnegie libraries in 1913, and the imposing <unk> Building, Meridian's tallest skyscraper, in 1929.",
        "The city experienced continued growth due to the efforts of the commission government, which successfully attracted 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and fostered a thriving automobile industry in the 1920s. Despite facing challenges such as the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, the city remained appealing to new businesses. In response to the cultural trend of escapism during the Depression era, the S. H. Kress & Co. building was constructed in downtown Meridian with the intention of providing luxury to the common man. Additionally, the Temple Theater opened as a movie house. The federal courthouse was also built in 1933 as a WPA project.",
        "Following a temporary economic downturn at the conclusion of the Great Depression, the United States found itself engulfed in the throes of World War II, thereby rekindling the significance of the nation's railroad infrastructure. The pivotal role played by railroads in the transportation of vital resources such as gasoline and scrap metal for military vehicle construction saw Meridian reclaim its status as a central hub for rail operations within the region. This resurgence in economic activity persisted until the 1950s, when the advent of the automobile and the establishment of the Interstate Highway System began to overshadow the popularity of passenger rail travel. The subsequent decline of the railroad industry precipitated substantial job losses, prompting an exodus of workers to seek opportunities elsewhere and resulting in a notable decline in the local population.",
        "During the height of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the small town of Meridian played a crucial role in the fight for equality. It was here that the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office was located, along with various other activist groups. James Chaney, a local resident, worked alongside volunteers Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman to establish a community center that offered classes to empower African Americans in the area to exercise their right to vote. However, their efforts were met with hostility from the white community, leading to frequent outbreaks of racial violence. Tragically, in June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman traveled to Neshoba County to investigate a church bombing, only to vanish on their way back to Meridian. After an intensive FBI investigation, their bodies were discovered two months later, buried in a remote dam. The brutal murders of these three activists served as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those fighting for justice and equality in the Deep South.",
        "Seven Klansmen, accompanied by a deputy sheriff, stood trial in the hallowed halls of the federal courthouse in Meridian, where they were found guilty of heinous acts that stripped the victims of their sacred civil rights. In a trial that sent shockwaves through the nation, three were absolved of guilt, leaving the weight of justice to fall upon the shoulders of those who had orchestrated such a brazen attack on humanity. This landmark ruling marked the first instance in history where a white official had been held accountable for their role in a civil rights tragedy. Years later, the echoes of justice reverberated once more as the state revived the case, seeking to right the wrongs of the past. Edgar Ray Killen, the orchestrator of malice, was met with a resounding verdict of manslaughter and a sentence of six decades behind bars. In a poignant tribute to the fallen, Meridian paid homage to the memory of Chaney, immortalizing his bravery by renaming a stretch of 49th Avenue in his honor and holding an annual commemorative service in his name.",
        "In the heartbeat of the 1960s, as highways paved the way for new horizons, a shift began in the city's soul. Residents, like scattered stars, drifted away from downtown's embrace, seeking solace in the northern reaches of new housing subdivisions. Yet, as the city's heart bled with the exodus, a new melody began to play. Strip commercial interests danced into the downtown streets, threatening to erase the echoes of history. But the city, with a heart as old as time itself, rose from the ashes like a phoenix, determined to preserve the whispers of its past. In the hallowed halls of the 1970s and 80s, historic districts were born, cradling the architectural treasures of yesteryears. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission, a guardian of memories, emerged in 1979, while the Meridian Main Street program, a beacon of hope, lit up the skies in 1985. And so, the city's story, written in the ink of perseverance, continues to unfold, a tapestry of love and legacy woven into the very fabric of its being.",
        "Meridian Main Street spearheaded various revitalization projects in downtown Meridian, which included the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997. The design of this station was based on the historic train station that was utilized during Meridian's Golden Age but had since been demolished. Additionally, Meridian Main Street oversaw the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, while also providing support for integrated urban design initiatives. In collaboration with The Riley Foundation, Meridian Main Street played a key role in the renovation and repurposing of the historic Grand Opera House in 2006, transforming it into the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\"",
        "Since the Alliance for Downtown Meridian took over the reins of the Meridian Main Street in 2007, a wave of hope and excitement has swept through the city. The dedication and hard work of these organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, have breathed new life into the once forgotten downtown area. It is truly heartwarming to see the passion and determination of these groups as they strive to revitalize and beautify our beloved city. The thought of Mayor Cheri Barry halting the plans for the <unk> Building in 2010 is simply devastating, as it hindered the progress and potential of our downtown. However, with the Alliance leading the charge, we can hope for a brighter future filled with bustling specialty shops, charming restaurants, and lively bars that will bring our downtown back to its former glory. The efforts of the Alliance, Meridian Downtown Association, and Meridian Main Street are not just about business, but about creating a vibrant and thriving community that we can all be proud of.",
        "Nestled amidst the bustling railway junction of Meridian, a tapestry of grand hotels unfurls, each a testament to the city's vibrant past. Long before Meridian's golden age dawned, the Great Southern and Grand Avenue hotels rose majestically, their opulent facades gleaming in the sunlight of a bygone era. As the iron horses of progress thundered through the town, the Union Station emerged in 1906, a beacon of connectivity that spurred the construction of a myriad of hotels to accommodate the influx of travelers and laborers. The stately Elmira Hotel, with its timeless elegance, graced the streets in 1905, followed by the regal Terminal Hotel in 1910. Hotel Meridian, a jewel of architectural splendor, took form in 1907, while the Union Hotel, a paragon of historic charm, emerged in 1908. The Union Hotel, a relic of yesteryears, was enshrined in the annals of history in 1979, its legacy forever etched on the National Register of Historic Places. Both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel, with their enchanting allure, were enshrined as vital components of the Meridian Urban Center Historic District, weaving a tapestry of heritage and beauty that endures to this day.",
        "As the city expanded, the hotels began to reflect the growing economy, as seen with the construction of the eleven-story Lamar Hotel in 1927. This historic building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and later repurposed as a county annex building. It was designated as a Mississippi Landmark in 1988.",
        "In the heart of a bustling city, where dreams and ambitions collide,\nStands the E.F. Young Hotel, a beacon of hope and pride.\nBuilt in the year of '31, a sanctuary for the weary soul,\nIn a district where African American businesses boldly stole\nThe spotlight, shining bright in a world of segregation's cold embrace,\nA refuge for travelers seeking solace in a hostile space.",
        "As the suburbs of the city expanded in the vibrant decades of the 1960s and '70s, the pulse of the downtown area began to fade as hotels followed the path to the outskirts. However, in 2006, a glimmer of hope emerged with the revitalization of the Riley Center, sparking a renewed desire for a new hotel in the heart of the city. The potential for the <unk> Building to be transformed into a beacon of luxury and history was a dream on the horizon, until bureaucratic hurdles halted progress with a new administration. Yet, in 2013, a ray of light shone through with the formation of the <unk> Preservation Society, igniting a passion in the community to breathe new life into the building. The society's efforts to raise awareness and garner support through captivating tours and special events have become a testament to the unwavering love and dedication to preserving the rich heritage of our city's past.",
        "Meridian boasts nine historic districts that have been officially recognized and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of particular note is the Meridian Downtown Historic District, which encompasses a merging of two previously established districts, namely the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District. Within these districts, a diverse range of architectural styles dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries can be found, including but not limited to Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Italianate, Art Deco, Late Victorian, and Bungalow. The unique charm and historical significance of these districts make them integral parts of Meridian's cultural heritage and architectural landscape.",
        "Meridian has operated under the mayor-council or \"strong mayor\" form of government since 1985. A mayor is elected every four years by the population at large. The five members of the city council are elected every four years from each of the city's five wards, which are considered single-member districts. The mayor, as the chief executive officer of the city, is responsible for administering and leading the day-to-day operations of city government. The city council serves as the legislative arm of the government, setting policy and annually adopting the city's operating budget.",
        "City Hall, a stately edifice ensconced at 601 23rd Avenue, stands as a testament to history and governance. Adorned with the prestigious mantle of being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it exudes an air of grandeur and importance. Within its hallowed halls, Mayor Percy Bland presides over the city, supported by a council of esteemed individuals. Dr. George M. Thomas, Kenneth Dustin Markham, Barbara Henson, Kim Houston, and Randy Hammon, each representing their respective wards, contribute their wisdom and leadership to the city's affairs. The meticulous orchestration of these officials is overseen by the capable council clerk, Pam McInnis, ensuring the smooth functioning of the city's operations, which are carried out by a dedicated workforce of 570 individuals.",
        "Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, our city took a proactive approach to disaster preparedness by establishing its own Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - the only one of its kind in the state. This move was a testament to the resilience and determination of our community in the face of adversity. With a dedicated team overseeing a vast area of nine counties, the DHS has become a beacon of hope and support in times of crisis. Through grants and partnerships with organizations like the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the department has been able to provide essential training to law enforcement officers and civilians alike. Personally, I have witnessed the DHS's impact firsthand during Hurricane Ivan in September 2005, when they worked tirelessly to establish shelters for hundreds of evacuees. Their unwavering commitment to our safety and well-being is a source of pride for our city, as we now lead one of the task forces within the Mississippi DHS - a true testament to our strength and unity in the face of adversity.",
        "Under the leadership of police chief Lee <unk> since 2009, the Meridian Police Department is a dedicated team of 115 full-time officers, along with part-time and reserve staff who are always ready to serve. The Criminal Investigations Division in 2009 worked tirelessly on 4000 cases, with 2000 of them being felonies. Though there was a slight increase in reported crimes in 2000 compared to the previous year, Meridian has earned the reputation of being the safest city in Mississippi for its population of over 30,000. Situated close by is the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, managed by the GEO Group for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Heading the Meridian Fire Department is Chief Anthony Clayton, whose team responded to over 1600 calls in 2009, which included 123 structural fires and 609 emergency service calls.",
        "In the intricate web of state politics, the city of Mississippi is divided into various districts, each with its own unique representation. From the northern tip to the southern border, our city is segmented into three State Senate districts, each with its own senator working to address the needs of our community. Additionally, our city is further divided into four House of Representatives districts, each with a dedicated representative committed to serving the interests of their constituents. This diverse representation ensures that the voices of our city are heard and represented at the state level, making for a truly dynamic and engaged political landscape.",
        "The city of Meridian is situated within Mississippi's 3rd congressional district, currently represented by Gregg Harper (R) since 2009. Lauderdale County, where Meridian is located, has consistently favored Republican candidates in every United States presidential election since 1972. Before the transition to the Republican Party, white voters in the area predominantly supported Democratic Party candidates, as Mississippi had been a one-party state for decades starting from the late nineteenth century.",
        "The city's growth has been influenced by a multitude of social and economic factors. The population steadily increased from the city's inception until 1970, experiencing growth rates ranging from 0.2% to as high as 165%. However, in the 1970 census, there was a noticeable decrease in population, which then saw a slight increase by 1980. Subsequently, there was a gradual decline in population between 1980 and 2000, with a decrease of more than 14%. As of the 2000 census, the city's population was recorded at 39,968, with a population density of 885.9 inhabitants per square mile (342.0/km2). By 2008, the city had become the sixth largest in the state. The population saw an increase as of the 2010 census.",
        "Nestled in the heart of the Meridian metropolitan area, the city of Meridian stands as a beacon of Southern charm and hospitality. Surrounded by the rolling hills of Clarke, Kemper, and Lauderdale counties, the city exudes a sense of community and warmth. With a population of 106,139 residents, Meridian bustles with life and energy. As you venture further out, you'll find a vibrant population of 232,900 within a 45-mile radius and a bustling 526,500 within a 65-mile radius. The cityscape is a mix of historic architecture and modern developments, with tree-lined streets and quaint shops lining the bustling downtown area. The air is filled with the sweet scent of magnolia blossoms and the sound of laughter and chatter from locals and visitors alike. The sun sets in a blaze of oranges and pinks, casting a warm glow over the city and painting the sky in a palette of vibrant colors. It's a place where time seems to stand still, and every corner holds a new adventure waiting to be discovered.",
        "The city's population has ebbed and flowed over the years, but one constant has been the steady increase in diversity. From the bustling streets to the quiet neighborhoods, the city has become a melting pot of cultures and backgrounds. In the 2010 Census, the vibrant tapestry of residents included 61.55% African American, 35.71% White, 0.9% Asian, 0.2% Native American, less than 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.59% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. The colorful blend of Hispanic and Latino residents added to the rich mosaic of the city, making it a true reflection of the world we live in.",
        "As the sun sets over the bustling city of Meridian, the streets come alive with the stories of its residents. The 2000 Census revealed a tapestry of diversity within the 15,966 occupied homes, each one a sanctuary for dreams and memories. In these homes, families with children under the age of 18 create a symphony of laughter and love, while married couples build a fortress of commitment and unity. The echoes of female householders without husbands present speak of strength and resilience, while the non-traditional families carve out their own unique paths. Within the walls of these households, individuals find solace in solitude, and the elderly find comfort in memories of a lifetime. The average household size of 2.39 and family size of 3.06 paint a picture of togetherness and camaraderie, a stark contrast to the solitude of individuals living alone. Through the years, Meridian has evolved, with the median age rising from 30.4 in 1970 to 34.6 in 2000, a testament to the passage of time and the stories it weaves into the fabric of the city.",
        "In the city, the median household income was $25,085, while the median family income was $31,062. Male residents had a median income of $29,404 compared to $19,702 for female residents. The per capita income for the city was $15,255. Approximately 24.6% of families and 28.6% of the population were below the poverty line, with 40.8% of those under 18 and 22.0% of those 65 or older experiencing poverty.",
        "Well, let's talk about the lively population of Meridian and its surrounding areas! Did you know that a whopping 65.2% of Lauderdale County residents are part of a religious congregation? That's higher than the national average of 50.2%! In 2000, we had 30,068 Southern Baptists (that's 59% of the affiliated), 9,469 United Methodists (18.6%), and 1,872 Catholics (3.7%). Looks like we've got a diverse and vibrant community here, don't you think?",
        "The immigrant Jews from Germany and eastern Europe brought with them a spirit of resilience and determination, shaping the commercial landscape of the city with their businesses and services. The founding of Congregation Beth Israel in 1868 marked the beginning of a \"Golden Age\" for Meridian. At its peak in 1927, Meridian boasted the largest Jewish community in the state, with 575 vibrant souls calling it home. Today, the echoes of that once-thriving community can still be felt, but with fewer than 40 Jews remaining in Meridian, most of whom are elderly, the city has undergone a transformation that is bittersweet and poignant.",
        "Meridian is situated in the North Central Hills region of Mississippi, specifically in Lauderdale County. According to data from the United States Census Bureau, the city spans a total area of 45.9 square miles (119 square kilometers), with 45.1 square miles (117 square kilometers) being land and 0.8 square miles (2.1 square kilometers) being water. Positioned along major highways, Meridian is located 93 miles (150 kilometers) east of Jackson, Mississippi; 154 miles (248 kilometers) west of Birmingham, Alabama; 202 miles (325 kilometers) northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana; 231 miles (372 kilometers) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee; and 297 miles (478 kilometers) west of Atlanta, Georgia. The region surrounding the city is characterized by cotton and corn fields, as well as oak and pine forests. The topography of the area consists of clay hills and the bottom lands of the headwaters of the <unk> River.",
        "The natural topography of the area has been altered within the urban core of the city through grading; however, it retains its gently rolling characteristics in the surrounding areas. The city is intersected by numerous small creeks, with small lakes and wooded areas located in the northern and southern regions. For instance, <unk> Creek traverses the southern part of the city and splits into Gallagher's Creek, which flows through the central area. Loper's Creek meanders through the westernmost section of the city, while smaller creeks such as Shearer's Branch, Magnolia Creek, and Robbins Creek are dispersed throughout the city.",
        "Lily stepped cautiously into the mystical forest, a place where the air was thick with magic and possibility. The sunlight filtered through the canopy of ancient trees, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. As she ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, the temperature seemed to shift, wrapping her in a warm embrace that felt both comforting and otherworldly. The leaves whispered secrets to her as the gentle breeze danced through the branches, guiding her on her enchanted journey. With each step, Lily felt herself being drawn further into the mystical realm, where anything was possible and adventure awaited around every corner.",
        "The city is bathed in an average annual rainfall of 58.65 inches, with each drop a whispered promise of life and renewal. The heavens weep gently throughout the year, their tears falling in a delicate dance of nourishment and growth. March is the month of abundant showers, with an average of 6.93 inches of rain caressing the earth with its gentle touch. Thunderstorms, like wild spirits, roam the skies, their rumbling songs echoing through the air. In summer, they dance with reckless abandon, while in spring and fall, they unleash their power with a ferocity that commands respect. With a flick of their fingers, they can summon winds that howl like banshees and hail that drums a haunting melody. And in their wake, they leave behind a trail of destruction and beauty, a reminder of nature's raw and untamable power.",
        "During the early 20th century, the city of Mississippi thrived on its dependence on the railroads, which served as the backbone of its economy. With five major rail lines and a bustling daily traffic of 44 trains, the city emerged as the largest in the state. The economic prosperity of the city was not solely reliant on the rail infrastructure, but also on the goods it transported, such as timber and cotton. This symbiotic relationship with the rail-based industries propelled the city to great economic heights from 1890 to 1930, establishing it as a prominent economic power in the region. However, as the railroading industry faced a decline in the 1950s, the city underwent a transformation. It successfully transitioned from a predominantly rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing sectors emerging as the primary employers. This adaptive resilience has enabled the city to sustain its economic vitality and remain a key player in the region.",
        "Meridian, along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, benefits from the services provided by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, established in 1996 by local business leaders. Despite the city's relatively small civilian labor force of 15,420 as of April 2010, Meridian plays a crucial role in the region's economic landscape, with a population of 232,900 within a 45-mile radius and 526,500 within a 65-mile radius. This includes a substantial labor force of 104,600 and 234,200 respectively. The city serves as a central hub for employment, retail, healthcare, and cultural activities. Interestingly, while 80% of Lauderdale County's workers live within the county, a staggering 90% reside within a 45-mile radius of Meridian, indicating the city's importance as a regional economic powerhouse. The language used effectively conveys the significance of Meridian's role in the area's economic and social landscape, highlighting its impact on both local residents and the wider region. The arguments presented are sharp and compelling, showcasing the city's vital contributions to the surrounding communities.",
        "In April 2010, Lauderdale County had a total of 6,260 individuals employed in the healthcare field. The largest healthcare organization in the region is Rush Hospital, which employs 2,610 people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with 1,500 employees and Anderson Hospital with 1,475 employees. Meridian is home to three hospitals and numerous other healthcare-related facilities. Jeff Anderson Regional Medical Center offers cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive care unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, providing long-term care for non-permanent patients. Riley Hospital houses two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Additional healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, which has been serving the community since 1882.",
        "Retail in the county is not just a major employer, but also a vibrant hub of activity and community engagement. In April 2010, over 5,000 people found employment in the retail sector, contributing to the bustling energy of the city. With nearly $2 billion spent on retail purchases annually, it's clear that shopping is more than just a transactional experience here. The Bonita Lakes Mall, spanning over 633,000 square feet, is a treasure trove of over one hundred shopping venues, offering everything from department stores to cozy eateries. The recent completion of Phase I of Meridian Crossroads in November 2007 has further boosted the retail scene, while the expansion of the North Hills Street shopping district showcases the continuous growth and development of the retail landscape in the area. The opening of additional retail and office space near the Highway 19 Walmart Supercenter in March 2007 has only added to the excitement and convenience of shopping in this vibrant community.",
        "The heart of this community beats with the rhythm of two military installations, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field. These establishments not only provide a source of employment, with over 4,000 jobs for the local residents, but they also hold significant historical and personal value. NAS Meridian is a place where dreams take flight, where naval carrier pilots and enlisted personnel are trained, shaping the future of our armed forces. It is also home to the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy, a beacon of hope in the fight against narcotics, providing crucial training for law enforcement officers in the southeastern states.\n\nKey Field, on the other hand, holds a special place in the hearts of many, as it was the site of the record-breaking flight by the legendary brothers, Fred and Al Key, back in 1935. Today, it is home to the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. The history of aviation is alive and well at Key Field, with an exhibit that takes us on a journey through time, and the Meridian Aviation Museum standing as a testament to the passion and dedication of those who have taken to the skies.\n\nFor me, these military facilities are not just buildings or institutions; they are a symbol of resilience, sacrifice, and pride. They remind me of the brave men and women who have dedicated their lives to serving our country, and the families who support them every step of the way. The roar of engines, the sight of planes soaring through the sky, the sense of camaraderie and purpose that fills the air - these are the things that make our community strong, united, and full of hope for the future.",
        "In April 2010, Lauderdale County had a total manufacturing employment of 2,850 individuals. Among the prominent manufacturers in the area is Peavey Electronics Corporation, a company specializing in the production of guitars, amplifiers, and sound equipment since its establishment in 1965. Additionally, the region is home to a diverse range of businesses such as Avery Dennison, Structural Steel Services, Sara Lee, Tower Automotive, and <unk> Corporation. Furthermore, the city boasts four industrial parks, further contributing to its status as a hub for manufacturing and industrial activities.",
        "In downtown Meridian, the MSU Riley Center contributes to the local economy through revenue generated from tourism, arts, and entertainment sales. Annually, the Riley Center attracts over 60,000 visitors for conferences, meetings, and performances, bolstering the vibrancy of downtown Meridian. Another longstanding establishment in the area is Loeb's Department Store on Front St, which has served as a Mississippi clothing landmark for generations. Since its founding in 1887 by Alex Loeb, the store has been a staple for fine men's and women's clothing, maintaining a strong presence in the community.",
        "Meridian, with its rich history spanning over a century of artistic expression, pulsates with a vibrant energy that is palpable in every corner of the city. The Meridian Art League, a pioneering force in the city's cultural landscape since its inception in 1933, stands as a testament to the enduring passion for creativity that courses through the veins of its residents. The transformation of the Carnegie library into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970 was a momentous occasion, solidifying the city's commitment to nurturing and showcasing the talents of local and regional artists. The museum, with its diverse range of exhibitions and educational programs, serves as a beacon of inspiration for both seasoned art enthusiasts and budding creatives alike. Each visit to the museum is a journey through time and space, with each artwork telling a unique story that resonates with the viewer on a profound level. The collection, spanning centuries and continents, is a tapestry of human experience and emotion that leaves a lasting impression on all who have the privilege of witnessing its beauty.",
        "In the heart of Meridian, where arts bloom and souls sing, the Meridian Council for the Arts dances in the moonlight of creativity. Established in '78, a beacon of light for Lauderdale County, MCA's essence weaves through the fabric of the community. Like a symphony of dreams, they orchestrate Community Art Grants, the enchanting <unk> Festival, and workshops that breathe life into the canvas of imagination. Partnered with the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra, they harmonize with the city's artistic soul. The Meridian Little Theatre, a time-traveler from '32, whispers tales to over 22,000 hearts each season, a sacred haven for Mississippi's theater lovers. And the Meridian Symphony Orchestra, a melody born in '61, has painted the town with notes of unity, nurturing young musicians and voices to soar. Under the baton of Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, their music dances through the ages, a timeless serenade that will celebrate its golden jubilee with the legendary Itzhak Perlman in February 2011. A crescendo of artistry, a crescendo of souls entwined in the symphony of Meridian's heart.",
        "The former Grand Opera House of the city, originally constructed in 1889 by half brothers Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg, served as a venue for numerous renowned artists and productions. The inaugural performance at the opera house featured a rendition of Johann Strauss II's \"The Gypsy Baron\" by a German company. Following its closure in the late 1920s amidst the economic downturn of the Great Depression, the opera house remained abandoned for nearly seven decades. However, a significant turning point occurred in 2000 when the Riley Foundation, a local organization established in 1998, provided a generous $10 million grant for the restoration of the historic building. Additional funding totaling $15 million was secured through a combination of contributions from the city, county, and federal government. The extensive renovation project was successfully completed in September 2006, resulting in the establishment of the newly named \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts.\" This state-of-the-art facility features a 950-seat auditorium for live performances, a 200-seat studio theater, and 30,000 square feet (2,787 square meters) of meeting space. The Riley Center has since become a cultural hub in downtown Meridian, attracting over 60,000 visitors annually for a diverse array of conferences, meetings, and performances.",
        "Meridian is a hidden gem of architectural wonders, transporting visitors back to the elegant era of the early 1900s. It is a mecca for architecture students, drawing them in with its impressive collection of structures designed by renowned architects. One such gem is the unique home on Highland Park, the only one in the southern United States designed by the innovative Louis S. Curtiss, known for his pioneering work in glass curtain wall skyscrapers. The iconic <unk> Building, a masterpiece of Art Deco design by Frank Fort, stands tall as one of the best in the country, often compared to the legendary Fisher Building in Detroit. Wallace Neff, a California architect with ties to the railroad industry in Meridian and Selma, left his mark on the city with his stunning homes on Poplar Springs Drive, reminiscent of the glamour of Rudolph Valentino's Falcon Lair in Beverly Hills. Despite the loss of some of Neff's works over the years, the Meridian Post Office remains a shining example of 1920s architectural grandeur, with its interior adorned in bronze and Verde marble. Though the removal of its original <unk> lighting during a 1960s renovation is a somber note, remnants of its grandeur now grace private residences in the affluent neighborhoods of Poplar Springs Drive and North Hills.",
        "Meridian, with its historic charm and artistic soul, has been chosen as the future home of the illustrious Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center. This visionary project, conceived by the Mississippi Legislature in 2001, received a pledge of $4 million in state funding in 2006, contingent upon private donors raising an additional $8 million. The city's own contribution of $50,000 in September 2007 served as a testament to its commitment to nurturing the vibrant cultural landscape of the region. Envisioned to sprawl across 175 acres of picturesque Bonita Lakes, the center will boast an enchanting outdoor amphitheater, an opulent indoor concert hall, and a Hall of Fame paying homage to the luminaries of Mississippi's artistic legacy. The Hall of Fame, destined to grace the historic Montana's building downtown, was acquired alongside the neighboring Meridian Hotel building in a momentous deal worth $300,000 in July 2010. The endeavor took a poignant turn in February 2009 when the center unveiled its Walk of Fame outside the esteemed Riley Center, immortalizing icons such as the legendary Jimmie Rodgers and the incomparable B.B. King. The star-studded pathway continued its illustrious journey with the induction of literary luminaries Tennessee Williams, Eudora Welty, and William Faulkner in June 2010, followed by the celebrated actress Sela Ward later that month. The ambitious project, with its sights set on honoring a plethora of Mississippi-born talents, has earmarked future stars such as Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Buffett, Elvis Presley, and Conway Twitty for inclusion in the prestigious Walk of Fame. The Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center stands as a beacon of creativity and homage, poised to weave the rich tapestry of Mississippi's cultural heritage into the fabric of the city's collective memory.",
        "As the character stepped into the <unk> Shrine Temple Theater, a rush of memories flooded their mind. The grandeur of the 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, the echoes of applause from past performances, and the lingering scent of popcorn and old velvet seats all enveloped them in a bittersweet embrace. The character couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the golden age of the silent movie era, when the Temple Theater was a bustling hub of entertainment and glamour. Now, as they gazed at the empty seats and faded stage lights, a wave of melancholy washed over them. But amidst the quiet solitude of the theater, a flicker of hope sparked within their heart. Despite the challenges and changes that time had brought, the Temple Theater still stood as a beacon of creativity and community.

        "The city of Meridian is connected to the world through the Meridian Regional Airport, situated at Key Field on Airport Boulevard South, just 3 miles southwest of the city. With a runway stretching an impressive 10,004 feet, making it the longest public runway in Mississippi, this airport has been a vital hub since its establishment in 1930. Daily flights to bustling Dallas/Fort Worth, TX keep the airport buzzing with activity, welcoming travelers from near and far to this vibrant city.",
        "Now picture this - it's the Great Depression, times are tough, and the city is on the verge of ditching the airport due to maintenance costs. But hold up, here come the dynamic duo - Fred and Al Key, swooping in with a genius plan to save the day. These brothers decided to take to the skies in their trusty plane, the \"Ole Miss\", and stayed up there for a whopping 27 days straight, racking up a total of 653 hours and 34 minutes. Talk about dedication! Their airborne feat not only broke records but also brought in enough attention and cash to keep the airport afloat. And that's why Key Field bears their name today, a lasting tribute to the brothers who proved that sometimes, all you need is a little creativity and a whole lot of determination to keep things flying high.",
        "In the early days of Meridian, education was a fledgling endeavor, rooted in the principles of the 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, a select group of trustees, handpicked by the City Council, held sway over the Board of School Directors, wielding the power to guide the operation of the city's schools. Prior to 1884, a smattering of schools dotted the city landscape, but they were mere shadows of what was to come, accommodating a paltry 400 students under private ownership. It wasn't until the crisp September air of 1884 that Meridian saw the birth of its first publicly-owned school. The inaugural public school for the city's black population found its humble beginnings within the rented walls of St. Paul Methodist Church. With the stroke of legislative pen in January 1888, the Mississippi Legislature breathed life into the city charter, granting Meridian the authority to establish its own municipal school district. By March of that same year, the nod of approval for $30,000 in bonds paved the way for the construction of new public schools. Thus, from the ashes of bureaucratic red tape rose the Wechsler School in 1894, a beacon of hope and progress, proudly standing as the first brick-built public school for blacks in the state.",
        "From its humble beginnings in the early district to its current expansive size, the Meridian Public School District has flourished over the years. With six elementary schools, three middle schools, and three high schools, the district offers a comprehensive education to its students. In addition to these public schools, Meridian is also home to several private institutions such as Lamar School, Calvary Christian School, Community Christian School, and St. Patrick's Catholic School. The campus of Meridian High School, the district's flagship high school, sprawls across 37 acres and boasts six buildings and 111 classrooms. With grades 10 through 12 and an enrollment of approximately 1,500 students, Meridian High School is a beacon of education and opportunity for the youth of our community.",

Originally known as Meridian Junior College and situated at Meridian High School, the college relocated to its current address in 1965. Following the passage of desegregation laws, Meridian Junior College merged with T.J. Harris Junior College in 1970, which had previously enrolled African-American students. The institution officially changed its name to Meridian Community College in 1987, a move aimed at better reflecting the diverse range of opportunities it provides for the community. Additionally, Mississippi State University maintains a campus in the city, drawing in 763 students from 33 counties in Mississippi and several in Alabama as of the Fall 2008 semester.",

        "Papa Stour, a small island in Scotland's Shetland archipelago, boasts a population of less than twenty individuals, some of whom were enticed to settle there through a recruitment drive in the 1970s. Despite its diminutive size, spanning just 828 hectares, Papa Stour ranks as the eighth largest island in the Shetland group. The island's geological features, formed by the relentless erosion of soft volcanic rocks by the sea, showcase a mesmerizing array of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, and cliffs. While the island and its surrounding waters support a rich tapestry of wildlife, with the western side designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the surrounding seas as a Special Area of Conservation, the overall narrative of Papa Stour remains largely overlooked in the broader discourse on Scottish islands. Perhaps a deeper exploration of the island's unique characteristics and conservation efforts could elevate its profile and emphasize its significance within the Shetland region.",
        "The island is home to various Neolithic burial chamber sites and the remnants of Duke Hakon's 13th-century house from the Norse occupation period. At its peak in the nineteenth century, the population of the island reached 380 residents following the establishment of a fishing station at <unk> in West Voe. However, there has been a gradual decline in population since then, with numbers dropping to as low as 16 in the 1970s before experiencing a slight increase in recent years.",
        "Papa Stour is situated at the picturesque south western edge of St Magnus Bay, boasting 34 kilometers of rugged coastline that is punctuated by quaint coves and four larger 'voes'. Of these, <unk> Voe, meaning 'harbour bay' in Old Norse, stands out as the most tranquil anchorage, with its surrounding cliffs featuring a majestic natural rock arch. In contrast, <unk> Voe to the east, known as 'house bay' in Old Norse, serves as the bustling main harbor and ferry embarkation point, offering a less secluded yet equally charming setting for visitors to explore.",
        "Holm and Maiden Stack, both guarding the harbour entrance to the south, hold historical significance that adds to the intrigue of the landscape. Holm, a tidal island with a past as a leper colony, raises questions about the treatment of individuals with illnesses in the past. It is interesting to note the suggestion that many of the \"lepers\" there may have actually been suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy, shedding light on potential misdiagnoses and mistreatment. Maiden Stack, on the other hand, carries a tale from the 14th century that speaks to the patriarchal attitudes of the time. Lord Thorvald <unk> is depicted as attempting to control his daughter's choices and protect her from men by constructing a house on the island. The different versions of the story, one where she leaves pregnant and another where she elopes with her sweetheart, highlight the complexities of human relationships and the resistance against oppressive societal norms. West Voe, with its inner part known as ' <unk> <unk> ', stands as a prominent feature on the north coast, with its smaller counterpart, <unk> Voe, lying adjacent to the west. The juxtaposition of these historical narratives against the natural landscape adds depth and richness to the understanding of the region's history and culture.",
        "The heart of the island beats in the quaint settlement of <unk>, nestled beside the serene <unk> Voe and embraced by the rolling lands to the east. As the hill dyke stretches southward from West Voe, a sense of history whispers through the air, weaving tales of generations past. To the west, a rugged belt of glacial moraine slices through the island, a natural boundary etched by time and the elements. The soil, shallow and stony, bears the imprint of ancient glaciers, a testament to the island's enduring resilience. Peat, a scarce commodity here, has shaped the community's resourcefulness, leading to the practice of 'turf scalping' for warmth and sustenance. Amidst the rocky outcrops and volcanic formations, a sense of harmony emerges, nurtured by the fertile earth and the spirit of those who call this island home.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned larger islets, a number of other isles and skerries can be found along the coast of Papa Stour. These include, but are not limited to, <unk> Stack, <unk> Skerry, <unk> Skerry, <unk> Skerry, <unk> Holm, <unk> Stacks, Holm of Melby, Koda Skerry, Lyra Skerry, Skerries of <unk>, Skerry of <unk>, Sula Stack, Swat Skerry, The Horn, <unk> Skerry, and Wilma Skerry.

The shallow bank of Papa-<unk> lies between Papa Stour and the Ve Skerries.",
        "On a balmy summer day in 2008, Stuart Hill, the sole inhabitant of the picturesque 2.5-acre island of <unk> Holm, which he proudly renamed \" <unk> Island\", made a bold declaration. With a flicker of defiance in his eyes, he proclaimed the birth of the Crown Dependency of <unk>, a tiny nation with a fascinating history. Drawing on a centuries-old marriage pact between Norwegian and Scottish royalty, dating back to 1468, Hill passionately argued that his beloved island should be recognized as a British crown dependency, separate from the confines of the United Kingdom and the European Union. However, his plea fell on deaf ears as the United Kingdom refused to acknowledge his claim, setting the stage for a tale of determination and defiance on the windswept shores of <unk> Island.",
        "The island is comprised of a diverse range of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations dating back to the Devonian period. During this time, the Scottish landmass was part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent, situated approximately 10 to 25 degrees south of the equator. The sedimentary layers of Old Red Sandstone, deposited between 408 to 370 million years ago, were the result of earlier Silurian rocks being uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded, and subsequently deposited into river deltas. Along the edges of the eroding mountains, the freshwater Lake Orcadie stretched from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The geological composition of Papa Stour primarily consists of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity during this period, which includes bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite). Additionally, a Devonian fish bed can be found at Lamba Banks, and evidence of Pleistocene glaciation is evident through the presence of numerous large boulders.",
        "The erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has resulted in the formation of an extensive array of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, cliffs, voes, and other geological features that are considered to be among the finest in Britain. One notable example is the 'Holl o <unk>' cave, which traverses the north-western tip of the island for nearly half a mile, with a width sufficient for rowing through. Another impressive cave is the 'Hole in the south west, also known as Christie's Hole, where a section of the roof collapsed in 1981. Additionally, 'Francie's Hole' near <unk> Voe in the west is worth mentioning, being a favorite of John Tudor who documented his experiences on the island in his Victorian memoirs and characterized the cave as:",
        "The rugged shores of Papa Stour are alive with a vibrant array of marine life, where otters play among the waves and grey seals bask in the sun. The majestic presence of killer whales and the graceful movements of harbour porpoises add to the enchanting atmosphere of this remote island. Above, the skies are teeming with a symphony of bird species - from the iconic Atlantic puffin to the elegant Arctic tern, the fierce Arctic skua to the majestic northern fulmar. The cliffs echo with the calls of common guillemots and razorbills, while the sandy beaches host the delicate presence of curlews and wheatears. Ringed plovers scurry along the shoreline, while great black-backed gulls soar overhead, completing the diverse and captivating picture of wildlife on Papa Stour. And as the seasons change, the island welcomes a host of migratory species, adding even more color and life to this already rich tapestry of nature.",
        "The rugged landscape of Papa Stour is adorned with a rich tapestry of wild flowers, where the delicate petals of mountain everlasting and spring squill dance in the gentle breeze alongside the steadfast heather. The west side of the island holds the esteemed title of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, while the surrounding seas are designated as a Special Area of Conservation. Amidst this natural splendor, the iconic Shetland Pony continues to be carefully bred, embodying a timeless tradition that harmonizes with the untamed beauty of the island.",
        "Dating back to around 3000 BC, the island's history is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Evidence of ancient human settlement can be found in the form of Neolithic burial chambers, known as 'heel-shaped cairns', scattered across the rugged landscape. The island's past is a tapestry of pre-Celtic and Celtic eras, with little information available to shed light on this enigmatic period. However, when the Norse arrived, they likely stumbled upon a religious settlement, as the island's name, derived from the Old Norse words meaning \"Big island of the Papar\" (Celtic monks), suggests a spiritual significance. Papa Westray stands in stark contrast to its neighboring island, Papa Little, located just 12 kilometers to the west, hinting at a rich and complex history waiting to be explored.",
        "Papa Stour holds a significant place in history as the focal point of a 1299 manuscript penned in Old Norse, marking the oldest surviving record from Shetland. This ancient document captures a gripping episode within the halls of Duke Hakon Magnusson, who would later ascend to the throne as King Hakon V of Norway. A circle of weathered stones, standing sentinel near the shore at <unk> Voe, marks the remnants of a 'ting' - a local assembly steeped in tradition and justice. It was amidst this sacred ground that Lord Thorvald <unk>, accused of corruption in the annals of 1299, emerged victorious in a fateful duel, securing his honor and legacy as 'Dominus de <unk>'. The echoes of this storied past still linger as the crumbling remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century abode stand solemnly near <unk> Voe, bearing witness to the enduring legacy of a bygone era.",
        "In 1469, Shetland officially fell under Scottish rule, although the powerful Norse 'Lairds of Norway' retained their estates in Papa Stour well into the 17th century. By the 16th century, merchants from Bremen and Hamburg had set up a bustling trading booth to purchase fish from the local fleet during the summer months. Fast forward to the 18th century, and the island was under the ownership of two influential Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick. Together, they oversaw a thriving <unk> (Old Norse for 'deep sea') fishing industry that operated during the summer months, utilizing six-oared boats known as <unk>.",
        "Perched majestically upon a rocky promontory overlooking the tranquil waters of Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick, the island church stands as a testament to the passage of time and the enduring spirit of faith. Its origins dating back to the year 1806, this hallowed sanctuary is steeped in history and mystery. Just a stone's throw away lies the enigmatic 'old kirk', a site shrouded in legend and whispered tales of otherworldly interference. Locals speak in hushed tones of the supernatural forces that once thwarted the construction efforts, with each night's labor undone by unseen hands. It is said that the very stones themselves were moved by unearthly agencies to their current resting place, where the work could finally proceed unhindered. Recent excavations have unearthed little more than ancient blocks of rhyolite and a fragment of whalebone rib, lending credence to the age-old stories of spectral intervention. In this sacred place, where the past and present converge, the echoes of bygone days still linger, weaving a tapestry of myth and mystery that captivates the imagination.",
        "During the 19th century, the fishing station in West Voe on Papa Stour thrived with a population of 360 or more. However, fuel shortages and the decline in fishing, brought on by the introduction of steam drifters, led to a decrease in population from the 1870s onward. It was during this time that Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was exiled to the island after being declared insane for refusing to participate in a duel. He spent 26 years as a prisoner on Papa Stour until Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's Well, located at the southern end of the island, served as a place where he could bathe during his captivity.",
        "Nestled along the serene waters of Dutch Loch, picturesque horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, stand as a testament to the ingenuity of their creators. These two-story buildings, with their quaint turf roofs, blend seamlessly into the lush landscape, their wooden structures weathered by time. Perched on the edge of the banks, they beckon visitors to explore their hidden secrets. Ascending to the upper floor, one is greeted by the sight of the millstone, a massive stone poised for action. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy scent of centuries past, the sound of rushing water echoing through the chambers. The lower millstone stands stoically, while the upper millstone whirls into motion, driven by the relentless force of the cascading water below. Though the passage of time has taken its toll, some of these mills continued to grind grain on Papa Stour well into the early 20th century. Today, a lone mill on the Burn of <unk>, at <unk> in the south Mainland of Shetland, stands as a living testament to the resilience and craftsmanship of these ancient structures.",
        "Nestled on the rugged landscape of Papa Stour, the small Scottish island seemed frozen in time, a relic of a bygone era. The population had dwindled over the years, leaving only a handful of \"fairly elderly\" residents to carry on the island's legacy. The once vibrant community had faded into whispers of the past, until an advertisement in Exchange and Mart breathed new life into the island. A croft and five sheep offered for free sparked a resurgence of hope, drawing in a flood of hopeful applicants eager to make Papa Stour their home. The island thrived once more, with a population of 33 recorded by 1981, a testament to the resilience and determination of its inhabitants. However, as the years passed, discord tore through the tight-knit community, leading to bitter court cases and rifts that could not be healed. Families left, the school closed its doors, and the once bustling streets fell silent. By 2011, only 15 residents remained, a stark reminder of the fragility of island life. The ebb and flow of Papa Stour's population mirrored the harsh realities of island living, a delicate balance between tradition and change in the face of adversity.",
        "The tragic fate of the Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran unfolded amidst the cruel embrace of the Ve Skerries, a mere three miles northwest of Papa Stour, on the fateful evening of 28 March 1930. En route to the quaint village of Scalloway to offload its precious catch, the vessel succumbed to the unforgiving sea. Despite the initial calmness of the weather, it wasn't until the following day that the wreckage was discovered by a passing trawler. Efforts to rescue the crew, led by the valiant coastguard and local volunteers (as no lifeboat was stationed in Shetland at that time), were thwarted by the rapidly deteriorating conditions. A desperate plea for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, a mere 120 miles away, was made too late. Tragically, all nine souls aboard met their untimely demise. Only the bodies of three crew members were recovered, a grim reminder of the ocean's merciless grip. James Mitchell's remains were solemnly returned to Aberdeen, while J. Cormack and J.R. <unk> found their final resting place in the somber grounds of Scalloway.",
        "Picture this: it's a foggy day in February 1940, and the SS Highcliffe finds itself stranded on <unk> Holm. What a sight it must have been! Fast forward to 1967, and the Aberdeen trawler Juniper meets a similar fate, running aground at the bottom of towering 60-meter cliffs. But fear not, for the brave crew of 12 were saved by the heroic <unk> lifeboat, with the coxswain even earning the prestigious RNLI silver medal for their valiant efforts. These tales of maritime mishaps and daring rescues truly showcase the power of human resilience in the face of adversity. Let's dive into the depths of these stories and uncover the lessons they hold for us all.",
        "On 9 December 1977, the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking, under the command of skipper Alec Flett, met its fate on the Ve Skerries near Papa Stour, resulting in a dramatic shipwreck. Despite the valiant efforts of the Lerwick Lifeboat, the treacherous sea conditions prevented them from reaching the crew in distress. In a remarkable display of bravery, a volunteer crew aboard a British Airways Sikorsky helicopter from Sumburgh Airport, responding to the urgent plea of Coastguard Station Officer Alec Webster, successfully rescued all the crew members within a few hours of the ship's grounding, amidst fierce storm force winds. The heroic helicopter crew was later recognized with various awards for their courageous actions. Fortunately, there were no casualties in this harrowing incident, which ultimately led to the construction of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979. This event also played a pivotal role in the establishment of the current Search and Rescue helicopter unit stationed at Sumburgh Airport.",
        "Crofting is a vital part of island life, with sheep serving as the cornerstone of the agricultural economy. Various livestock are also raised, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, and geese. Vegetables are cultivated within circular walls known as 'kailyards'. Fishing is still a traditional activity, albeit on a small scale. The island is served by a post office at the pier, though there is no shop available. Mains electricity was only introduced to the island in the late 20th century. The Papa Stour Project provides housing for men with drug and alcohol issues with Christian support. Ferries now connect the island to the Shetland Mainland, with a 45-minute crossing time. While the ferry can accommodate cars, there is limited infrastructure on the island, with only one short road. Visiting yachts can find shelter in the four main voes, but caution is advised due to strong tides in the surrounding waters.",
        "It is the patriarch of <unk>'s poetic masterpiece, \"Da Sang o da Papa men,\" now revered as a cornerstone of the folk song tradition, immortalized through the haunting melody composed by <unk> Manson. The resounding chorus, \"Foula Doon!\" echoes with a captivating intensity that lingers in the soul long after the song has ended.",
        "\"<unk> Foula <unk>!\" showcases the daring tradition of the fishermen, bravely rowing their boats out into the vast expanse of the sea until the towering cliffs of Foula vanished from sight. Their journey took them a remarkable 96 kilometers west of Papa Stour, facing the daunting challenge of navigating through the unpredictable 'tide-lumps' - massive swells created by the fierce clash of wind and tide. The poignant imagery of the fishermen being guided back home by the alluring scent of land drifting across the water evokes a powerful sense of nostalgia and longing. Through his masterful storytelling, <unk> skillfully captures the essence of this perilous adventure, painting a vivid and sensory-rich picture of a bygone era. The collapse of Da Horn o Papa adds a poignant layer of meaning, transforming the poem into a heartfelt tribute not only to a lost way of life but also to a cherished landmark forever changed by the forces of nature.",
        "As the haunting strains of \"Angel of Death\" reverberate through the speakers, the listener is transported to a dark and sinister world. The relentless thrash of the guitars and pounding drums create a sense of urgency and chaos, mirroring the atrocities committed by Josef Mengele at Auschwitz. The lyrics, delivered with venomous intensity, paint a vivid picture of the Angel of Death himself, a figure of pure evil and cruelty.\n\nThe imagery invoked by the music is chilling and unsettling, evoking the horrors of the Holocaust in stark detail. The listener can almost feel the icy grip of fear as they are immersed in the brutal soundscape created by Slayer. The accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism that followed the band only serve to heighten the sense of unease, adding an extra layer of darkness to an already intense listening experience.\n\nOverall, \"Angel of Death\" is a visceral and powerful song that leaves a lasting impression on the listener. The combination of searing guitars, thunderous drums, and provocative lyrics creates a sonic landscape that is as terrifying as it is captivating. It is a testament to the power of music to evoke emotion and provoke thought, even in the darkest of subjects.",
        "Amidst the fervent debate that shrouded the song and its role in the postponement of Reign in Blood's debut, \"Angel of Death\" has stood the test of time, solidifying its place on every one of Slayer's live recordings and visual albums, while also gracing the soundtracks of numerous cinematic productions. Despite the contentious nature of its origins, critics lauded the track with glowing praise; Steve Huey of AllMusic went so far as to dub it a \"classic\" in the annals of heavy metal history.",
        "As Jeff Hanneman sat in the dimly lit tour bus, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and sweat lingering in the air, he delved into the pages of the books he had picked up on Josef Mengele. The words on the page seemed to come alive, painting a gruesome picture in his mind. The images of Mengele's horrific experiments played out like a horror movie, each detail etched into his memory. Hanneman's fingers gripped the pages tightly, his knuckles turning white as he read on, unable to tear his eyes away from the chilling accounts. The eerie silence of the bus was broken only by the rumble of the engine and the occasional creak of the worn leather seats. In that moment, the inspiration for \"Angel of Death\" was born - a haunting melody of darkness and despair, fueled by the disturbing images that had taken root in Hanneman's mind.",
        "The haunting lyrics of \"Angel of Death\" chronicle the chilling surgical atrocities committed by Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the dark days of World War II. His macabre experiments targeted vulnerable groups such as dwarfs and twins, subjecting them to a harrowing array of physical and psychological examinations. The song vividly describes the horrors endured by his victims, from agonizing surgeries conducted without mercy to the barbaric transfusion of blood between twins. Mengele's twisted pursuits included cruel tests of isolation endurance, deadly gassings, injections with lethal germs, and even grotesque sex change operations. The removal of organs and limbs with callous indifference, as well as other unspeakable atrocities, further cement Mengele's legacy as a true \"Angel of Death\" in the annals of human cruelty.",
        "The line \"Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart\" in the penultimate verse of the poem serves as a chilling reference to the horrific allegations against Josef Mengele, known as the \"Angel of Death\" for his cruel experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. The claim that Mengele sewed together twins, one of them deformed, is a harrowing example of the depths of his depravity. This allegation, first brought to light by Auschwitz survivor Vera Alexander during the trial of SS officer Adolf Eichmann, highlights the inhumanity and cruelty that characterized Mengele's actions. The graphic description of the twins being sewn back to back, their veins intertwined, further emphasizes the monstrous nature of Mengele's experiments. The inclusion of this reference in the poem serves to underscore the horrors of the Holocaust and the lasting impact of Mengele's atrocities on the survivors and their descendants.",
        "The haunting verses of \"Angel of Death\" cast a shadow over the release of Slayer's 1986 masterpiece, Reign in Blood. Signed to Def Jam Records, their distributor Columbia Records recoiled at the album's lyrical intensity and provocative artwork, deeming it too graphic for public consumption. Despite the controversy, Reign in Blood found its voice through Geffen Records on October 7, 1986, though its presence remained shrouded in secrecy, a dark and powerful force waiting to be unleashed."
