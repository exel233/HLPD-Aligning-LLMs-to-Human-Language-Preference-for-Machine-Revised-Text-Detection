        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodríguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",
        "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981.

More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government",
        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade",

However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930.

        "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on",
        "John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases.

        "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the \"haircutting order\") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",
        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other",

In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les députés protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German",
        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at",

        "Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. \"plow\") accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of",

The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",
        "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that",
        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed – discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless.

        "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corvée\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage",

Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five",
        "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.",

In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week.

Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite",

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other.

It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine",

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.

        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie.

They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered England (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily.

        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space\". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating \"It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians",
        "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fernández Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists",
        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both:",

        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency",

        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple",

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti,",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely converting Iranian people from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia.

        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two",
        "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in",

        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed.

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish",

The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region.

The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.

        "The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.

        "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board",

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins",

The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections.

        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after",

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'() – early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from",
        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",
        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria",

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video.

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily",
        "It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).

        "Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.

The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

        "In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.",

As İnalcık mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" – key word being \"divine\".

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom",

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best",

        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in",

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an",

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to",
        "Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted",

In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd",

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to",

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes.

        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him.

        "Following the fall of Wu and the chaos of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), the elite Chinese families found themselves at a crossroads. Some chose to align with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north, leading to a loss of social privilege. Those who sought refuge headed south to the serene banks of the Yangtze River, seeking solace in the lush landscapes that beckoned to them.\n\nAmong these refugees were the descendants of Zhuge Liang (181–234), the revered chancellor of the state of Shu Han during the turbulent Three Kingdoms period. The clan of Zhuge Liang had once roamed the vast Central Plain of north China, but now they had found a new home in the outskirts of Hangzhou. Here, in a secluded corner of the world, they established Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun) - an exclusive enclave where only those bearing the prestigious family name \"Zhuge\" were welcome.\n\nThe village, shrouded in mystery and steeped in tradition, had deliberately isolated itself from the bustling world outside for centuries. Its ancient walls whispered tales of resilience and resilience, guarding the secrets of its inhabitants with unwavering vigilance. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the sound of rustling leaves, as if time itself had paused to pay homage to the resilience of these powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain.",

The arrival of Henry Rodríguez, lovingly called \"H-Rod,\" to bat cleanup brought a new dynamic to the lineup, offering protection for Sammy Sosa. Rodríguez's bat came alive, sending 31 balls soaring over the fences in his debut season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani shone as he led the team with a career-high 19 wins, while Rod Beck anchored the bullpen with unwavering strength. Mark Grace delivered a stellar performance, showcasing one of his finest seasons to date. The Cubs basked in the spotlight of the media throughout 1998, with Sosa and the rookie sensation Kerry Wood at the forefront. Wood's breakout moment came in a mesmerizing game against the Houston Astros, where he matched the major league record with 20 strikeouts in a single game. His electrifying strikeouts earned him the moniker \"Kid K\" and ultimately secured him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year accolade. Meanwhile, Sosa embarked on a scorching streak in June, smashing a remarkable 20 home runs, setting a new major league record that left fans in awe.",

While some of these risks, such as emotional distress stemming from fear of abuse or exploitation, as well as sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not inherently connected to adolescence, others like teenage pregnancy resulting from non-use or failure of contraceptives are viewed as significant social issues in many western societies. Shockingly, one in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Misconceptions lead adolescents in the United States to opt for \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity, mistakenly believing it reduces the risk of STIs.

        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the languages of the various regions and ethnicities took on their own unique identities. Before the 19th century, they were known by various names such as \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\", or \"Croatian\". The term Serbo-Croatian was coined by Jacob Grimm in 1824, and later popularized by Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar. It was officially recognized by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in the mid-1800s. Back then, the lands of the Serbs and Croats were still under the rule of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. The language was officially referred to in different ways, but unofficially, Serbs and Croats simply called it \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without making a distinction between the two. In independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were seen as three names for the same language.",

The vast Seleucid Empire, much like Egypt, was predominantly influenced by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities, who made up the dominant elite, were further bolstered by immigrants from Greece. These cities, including newly established colonies like Antioch, formed the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia, and Dura-Europos, maintained traditional Greek city-state institutions. However, these institutions were merely a facade, as they were always under the control of the royal Seleucid officials. In addition to the cities, the Seleucids strategically placed garrisons, military colonies, and Greek villages throughout the empire to solidify their rule.

        " The implications of identity in various research traditions are vast, with a growing emphasis on using identity as a lens to explore different phenomena. One fascinating area where the impact of identity can be seen is in occupational settings, particularly in stigmatized or \"dirty work\" environments. According to Hughes (1951), navigating identity construction in these settings can be quite challenging. Tracy and Trethewey (2005) suggest that individuals are drawn to or repelled from certain jobs based on how well they align with their desired \"organizational self.\" Different jobs come with their own set of stigmas or accolades, shaping how individuals perceive and choose their career paths. For instance, Tracy discusses correctional officers who struggle to break free from the stereotype of being seen as \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). The decision-making process behind occupational choices involves a complex interplay of justifications, values, workplace satisfaction, and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006). In these roles, individuals are constantly grappling with how their work identities align with their personal identities, shaping their experiences and perceptions within their professions.",

They are the whispers of our soul, echoing through the chambers of our physiology, entwined with the delicate balance of stress and serenity.

Just as the tides of emotion ebb and flow, so too do our temperaments shape the landscape of our social interactions, weaving a web of connection that stretches across the vast expanse of complex social systems. In this dance of genes and traits passed down through generations, our DNA holds the secrets of our existence, the blueprint that guides the assembly of proteins and cells that form the very core of our being.

        "Stanley Schachter built upon the pioneering research of Spanish physician Gregorio Marañón, who conducted experiments injecting patients with epinephrine and observing their emotional responses. Marañón discovered that while the patients experienced physiological arousal, they struggled to interpret this arousal as a specific emotion without a corresponding stimulus. Schachter expanded on this idea, acknowledging the significance of physiological reactions in shaping emotions. He proposed that these reactions helped individuals focus their cognitive appraisal of a situation, ultimately defining their subjective emotional experience. In essence, emotions were believed to result from a two-step process: initial physiological arousal followed by the interpretation of this arousal as a specific emotion. For instance, when faced with a threatening stimulus like a bear in the kitchen, the individual experiences a rapid heartbeat as part of the physiological response, which then informs their emotional experience.",

In the realm of academia during the Early Modern period, universities inherited the traditional subjects of the Middle Ages, including natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. The teachings of Aristotle and the works of Galen and Arabic scholars held sway in the curriculum. However, the dawn of humanism brought about a profound transformation in the academic landscape. With the advent of humanist professors, the focus shifted towards the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. These scholars placed a premium on cultivating students' abilities to write eloquently, speak persuasively, translate classical texts, and lead virtuous lives. The influence of humanism extended beyond the humanities, impacting scholars in fields such as medicine who incorporated humanist principles into their teachings. Figures like Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop were not just educators in their respective disciplines but also advocates of the humanist ethos that underscored the enduring significance of ancient texts.",

In 1765, an anonymous author in a French Enlightenment periodical arrogantly spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The subsequent years saw the proliferation of various self-congratulatory \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies, both Christian and secular, dedicated to the supposed betterment of humanity. After the French Revolution, the misguided belief that human virtue could be achieved solely through human reason, a notion erroneously associated with Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau, led to violent upheaval and societal chaos.",
        " The result of John's reign was a series of groundbreaking yet unpopular financial measures. He imposed scutage payments more frequently than his predecessors, even when there was no military campaign to fund. This went against the original purpose of scutage as an alternative to military service. John also took advantage of his power to demand relief payments for inherited estates and castles, often asking for exorbitant sums that his barons struggled to pay. Following the successful sale of sheriff appointments, John introduced a new round of appointments where the new sheriffs recouped their investment through increased fines and penalties, especially in the forests. He also expanded Richard's policy of charging widows who chose to remain single and continued to sell charters for new towns. John's financial innovations were ahead of their time but ultimately alienated the barons and fueled discontent among his subjects.",

The search for truth and meaning in a rapidly changing world brought about a range of conflicting emotions - from doubt and fear to hope and enlightenment.

        "Jefferson and James Madison's perspectives on the separation of church and state have sparked ongoing debates. Jefferson's refusal to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving from Congress during his presidency, coupled with his issuance of a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia, showcases a complex relationship with religion in government. Similarly, Madison's actions as President, where he issued four religious proclamations but vetoed two bills due to first amendment violations, highlight the nuanced approach to this issue. Despite both men attending religious services at the Capitol, Madison's pre-Constitution statement about religion being exempt from societal and legislative authority contrasts with his post-presidency advocacy for a total separation of church and state. Madison's emphasis on the strong separation between religion and government in the Constitution underscores the practical need for a clear distinction between the two realms. By examining the evolving stances of Jefferson and Madison on this issue, we can better understand the complexities of their views and how they have influenced the ongoing discourse on the separation of church and state in the United States.",

        "Terry Eastland, author of \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" posits that the primary arguments for affirmative action can be categorized as remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland argues that the original intent of affirmative action was not to benefit middle class minorities who may not necessarily need it, but rather to address historical injustices. She also contends that affirmative action can inadvertently create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities. Eastland suggests that the risks associated with affirmative action may outweigh the benefits, and that a merit-based system would foster more equitable competition. Similarly, libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\" highlights negative consequences of affirmative action policies, such as incentivizing individuals to falsely identify themselves as members of preferred groups in order to receive benefits.",

With Britain embroiled in a major conflict with Napoleon's France, its strategy was to obstruct American shipments to France. The United States aimed to maintain neutrality while continuing overseas trade. However, Britain disrupted this trade and impressed American seamen into the Royal Navy, despite vehement objections. Additionally, Britain supported an Indian uprising in the American Midwest, with the aim of establishing an Indian state to impede American expansion. In response, the United States officially declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, marking its first official declaration of war. Realizing the daunting task of confronting the formidable Royal Navy, the U.S. opted to attack the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining tool. Although the invasion of Canada proved to be a failure, concurrent conflicts with Native Americans on the western front, such as Tecumseh's War and the Creek War, yielded more favorable outcomes.

In the UK, Nicole records, consisting of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced from 1904 but plagued by excessive surface noise. Meanwhile, Columbia Records in the US launched the \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" in 1907, featuring fiber-cored pressings known for their noiseless surfaces when paired with special gold-plated Marconi Needles; however, the product's success was short-lived. In 1930, thin, flexible plastic records like the German Phonycord and British Filmophone and Goodson records emerged but faced similar fates.

It is uncertain whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have resulted in France's favor, as political parties advocating for an autonomous Alsace or connection to France held only a small percentage of votes in the last Reichstag and local elections. Alsatian autonomists, who supported French integration, garnered significant votes in rural areas and other towns following the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement began with the first Reichstag election, with elected representatives known as \"les députés protestataires.\" These representatives remained the only Alsatian deputies in the German government until Bismarck's resignation in 1890.",
        "During the tumultuous era of the formation of new kingdoms in Western Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire stood as a beacon of stability and prosperity. Its economic resurgence, extending well into the early 7th century, contrasted starkly with the turmoil plaguing its western neighbors. The eastern region of the empire faced fewer incursions, primarily concentrated in the Balkans, allowing for a period of relative peace. Remarkably, the age-old enmity with Persia remained dormant for much of the 5th century, fostering a rare tranquility in the volatile geopolitical landscape. In the Eastern Empire, the intricate interplay between the state and the Christian Church reached new heights, with theological debates shaping political discourse in ways unseen in the tumult of Western Europe. Legal advancements, such as the codification of Roman law, further defined the Eastern Empire's sophisticated governance. The Theodosian Code, a seminal legal document finalized in 438, paved the way for Emperor Justinian's monumental Corpus Juris Civilis, a comprehensive legal compilation that solidified the Empire's legal foundations. Justinian's reign was marked by grand architectural endeavors, including the iconic Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, and bold military campaigns that reclaimed North Africa and Italy from the Vandals and Ostrogoths, respectively. However, the conquest of Italy was marred by tragedy, as a devastating plague outbreak in 542 forced Justinian to shift his focus towards defensive strategies, casting a shadow over his later years in power.",
        "When Nintendo introduced the NES to the American market, the company made a deliberate choice to differentiate its design aesthetic from that of its competitors. This decision was motivated by a desire to distance the NES from the negative reputation that game consoles had garnered in the aftermath of the video game industry crash of 1983. One key aspect of this differentiation was the unique design of the cartridge slot, which was disguised as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, resembling the mechanism found in VCRs. While this design innovation was effective in creating a distinct visual identity for the NES, it was not without its drawbacks. The ZIF connector, despite its name, did not completely eliminate the need for force when inserting cartridges. As a result, repeated use of the connector caused wear and tear on the contact pins, leading to degradation of the system's performance over time.",
        "Protestants played a significant role in championing the cause of religious freedom. The concept of freedom of conscience held a prominent place on theological, philosophical, and political platforms following Martin Luther's steadfast refusal to retract his beliefs at the Diet of Worms in 1521. Luther argued that faith was a divine gift bestowed by the Holy Spirit and should not be coerced. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots also advocated for freedom of conscience, advocating for the separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys penned works defending religious freedom, which in turn influenced the views of notable figures like John Milton and John Locke on tolerance. Under the guidance of leaders like Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, colonies like Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania integrated democratic principles with religious freedom in their constitutions. These regions served as sanctuaries for persecuted religious minorities, including the Jewish community. The principles of religious freedom enshrined in the United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights were deeply influenced by the efforts of these early advocates.",
        "Birds possess a remarkable respiratory system that allows for efficient diffusion of oxygen into their blood. With a surface area to gas exchange volume ratio ten times greater than mammals, birds have a unique advantage in oxygen absorption. Their arteries are fortified with thick elastic muscles, designed to withstand the pressure of ventricular constriction, and gradually become more rigid as they extend from the heart. Blood flows through these arteries, undergoing vasoconstriction, before reaching arterioles that serve as a vital transportation system, distributing oxygen and nutrients to every corner of the body. As the arterioles branch out into individual organs and tissues, they further divide to enhance surface area and regulate blood flow. Finally, the journey culminates in the intricate network of capillaries, where essential gas exchange takes place. These capillaries form organized beds within tissues, facilitating the exchange of gases and nutrients essential for the bird's survival.",

        "One century following the historic fall of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon vividly captured the essence of a bygone era in his seminal work, Observations of 1553. Within its pages, he unveiled the intriguing tale of pissasphalto, a mysterious concoction of pitch and bitumen that found its humble origins in the ancient city of Dubrovnik. From these shores, this enigmatic substance embarked on a journey across the seas to the bustling marketplaces of Venice, where it beckoned to be acquired by all who sought its dark and elusive allure. Centuries later, the echoes of history reverberated through the hallowed pages of an 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine, recounting the early utilization of asphalt in the majestic lands of France. A weathered pamphlet, penned in the year 1621 by the enigmatic \"Monsieur d'Eyrinys\", unveiled a tantalizing revelation - the abundant presence of asphaltum in the verdant environs of Neufchatel. His grand design to harness this newfound treasure for the construction of impermeable granaries and the safeguarding of Parisian waterways against the encroachment of grime and decay, stood as a testament to the boundless ingenuity of mankind.",

        "Some street trams, also known as streetcars, utilized conduit third-rail current collection systems. In this setup, the third rail was situated below street level, and the tram would access the current through a plough, also referred to as a plow in the United States, which was inserted through a narrow slot in the road. This method of current collection was adopted in certain areas of the United States, such as Washington, D.C. (where the streetcar system was discontinued in 1962), and Manhattan, to avoid the visual clutter of overhead wires and poles commonly associated with electric traction. Remnants of this unique operational technique can still be observed, for example, on the tracks descending the incline leading to the disused Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails remains visibly discernible. Similarly, remnants of this system can also be seen on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the historic Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.",

        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles delve deeply into the complexities of applying FST to human populations. They eloquently debunk the notion that all human populations contain 85% of genetic diversity, as it oversimplifies the intricate tapestry of human history. They urge us to look beyond the surface, to see that human groups are not isolated entities but rather interconnected branches on the tree of life. Some groups, they explain, are like guiding stars, leading the way for others to follow in their genetic footsteps. For instance, the African population, according to the recent African origin theory, serves as the ancestral beacon from which all non-African populations trace their origins. This dynamic interplay of genetic lineage is a poetic dance of connection and divergence, painting a richer, more nuanced portrait of human diversity.",
        " Libya's economy saw an increase in privatization during this period. Government officials, while rejecting socialist policies of nationalized industry, claimed they were implementing a form of \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi expressed support for these reforms in a speech in March 2003, advocating for widespread privatization. By 2003, much of the oil industry had been sold to private corporations, leading to a significant increase in direct foreign investment in Libya to $40 billion by 2004. Some sectors of the population protested against these changes, leading to public demonstrations. In March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet and slowed the pace of reforms, but did not stop them entirely. Plans were announced in 2010 to privatize half of the Libyan economy over the next decade, although political control remained concentrated in Gaddafi's hands. In March 2010, the government did delegate more power to municipal councils, marking a slight shift in governance.",

        "Minister Litvinov with Molotov was not just a political maneuver, but a seismic shift in the emotional landscape of international relations. Litvinov, with his anti-fascist stance and pro-Western leanings, was a beacon of hope in a darkening world. His dismissal, orchestrated by Stalin's ruthless decree to \"purge the ministry of Jews,\" was a betrayal of ideals and a chilling reminder of the depths to which diplomacy could sink. As Molotov stepped into his shoes, the air crackled with uncertainty and fear. His \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan\" approach sent shivers down the spines of those who had once looked to Litvinov for guidance. The loss of Litvinov was not just a loss of a skilled diplomat, but a loss of humanity and compassion in a world teetering on the brink of chaos. The stage was set for a new era of power plays and betrayals, where emotions ran high and trust was a luxury few could afford.",
        "Critics have painted a damning picture of Muammar Gaddafi, labeling him as \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\". Western governments and media outlets have portrayed him as a \"vicious dictator\" who oppressed his own people. The Reagan administration in the United States went as far as to designate Gaddafi as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and famously referred to him as the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". Critics argue that under Gaddafi's rule, the Libyan people lived in constant fear due to the government's extensive surveillance of civilians, leading to the characterization of Libya as a \"police state\" by western commentators. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have documented numerous abuses in Gaddafi's Libya, including the lack of fair trials for political opponents, torture, and extrajudicial executions. The infamous massacre at Abu Salim prison on 29 June 1996, in which HRW estimated hundreds were killed, stands as a stark example of the brutality under Gaddafi's regime.",

        " Great allowed the Jews to return to their homeland and rebuild the Second Temple.\n\nThe Israelites, a people steeped in ancient history and tradition, experienced moments of political autonomy that shaped their identity. The era of the Biblical judges and the United Monarchy marked periods of self-governance and unity for the Israelites. However, after the fall of the United Monarchy, the land was divided into Israel and Judah, with the term \"Jew\" originating from the Roman term \"Judean\" to denote those from the southern kingdom of Judah. This shift in ethnonym was not explicitly mentioned in the Torah but was made clear in the Book of Esther, a text from the Jewish Tanakh. \n\nTragedy struck in 587 BC when Nebuchadnezzar II, the formidable King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroying the sacred First Temple and deporting the elite citizens of Judah. The year 586 BC marked the end of Judah's independence as a kingdom, leaving its people without a homeland. For decades, the Jews remained in exile, their spirits longing for a return to their ancestral land. Finally, in 539 BCE, the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon, and under the decree of the benevolent Cyrus the Great, the Jews were granted permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Second Temple, a symbol of their resilience and faith.",

However, Wang and Nyima challenge this assertion, contending that these interactions were not truly diplomatic in nature. They argue that the Ming exerted control over Tibetan territories by appointing Tibetan leaders as Ming officials and collecting horses from Tibet as a compulsory \"corvée\" tax, thus characterizing the exchanges as more aligned with domestic governance than international diplomacy. Sperling offers a contrasting viewpoint, noting that the Ming engaged in horse procurement from the Kham region while simultaneously confronting Tibetan factions in Amdo and hosting Tibetan envoys in Nanjing. Additionally, he suggests that visits by Tibetan lamas to the Ming court were primarily aimed at fostering commercial relations between the lamas' affluent retinue and Ming Chinese merchants and officials.

        "Plumage is regularly moulted in birds, with the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage. Breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are referred to as \"alternate\" plumages in the Humphrey-Parkes system. Moulting typically occurs annually in most species, although some may experience two moults a year, while large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species, with passerines typically replacing flight feathers one at a time starting with the innermost primary. As the moult progresses, the outer feathers are shed in a centrifugal fashion. The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary feathers they overlap.",
        "In the southeastern region of Europe, the emergence of agrarian societies can be traced back to the 7th millennium BC, as evidenced by the discovery of one of the earliest farming sites in Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. The presence of anthropomorphic figurines in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette), further signifies the early development of cultural practices in this region. Notable cultural complexes such as the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded into the Balkans and gave rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča, demonstrate the progression and diffusion of Neolithic traditions through a combination of cultural exchange and population movements. It is suggested that the Vinča culture may have been responsible for the creation of the earliest known system of writing, the Vinča signs, although archaeologist Shan Winn posits that these symbols likely functioned as pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed form of writing.",

        "In both Europe and the United States, green is widely recognized as the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. However, it is important to note that green also carries additional connotations in these regions, such as associations with death, sickness, or the devil. Conversely, in Chinese culture, green symbolizes positive attributes such as fertility and happiness. Throughout history, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, the color green was often worn by individuals of the merchant class, bankers, and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. This distinction in color symbolism is evident in various cultural contexts, such as the green attire worn by the Mona Lisa in Leonardo da Vinci's famous portrait, indicating her non-noble lineage. Additionally, the color green is traditionally linked to notions of safety and permission, as exemplified by the use of a green light to signal permission to proceed and the issuance of a green card for permanent residency in the United States.",

In a bold move, Libya initiated clandestine discussions with the British government in 1999 to mend relations. By 2001, Gaddafi unequivocally denounced the heinous September 11 attacks, showcasing solidarity with the victims and advocating for Libyan participation in the global fight against extremist terrorism. Despite cracking down on domestic radicalism, Gaddafi paradoxically championed for the broader implementation of sharia law. Libya's alliances with powerhouse nations like China and North Korea were solidified, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin making a historic visit in April 2002. Moved by the tumultuous aftermath of the Iraq War, Libya made a momentous decision in December 2003 to relinquish its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, effectively dismantling its chemical and nuclear weapons programs.

The mandate led Liberius on a sorrowful journey to the distant realm of Beroea, nestled in the rugged embrace of Thrace. Hopeful of swaying the steadfast heart of the exiled bishop, Constantius dispatched opulent gifts, alluring with the gleam of five hundred golden coins, destined to \"bear his charges.\" Yet, Liberius, resolute in his unwavering faith, spurned the tempting bounty, casting aside the riches as one might discard frivolous trinkets. With righteous defiance, he proclaimed that such treasures were better suited for the sycophants who sought to ensnare his soul. Even the entreaties of the empress, laden with a similar bounty, fell upon deaf ears, as Liberius stood firm in his devotion to the divine. In a daring act of defiance, he cast the lavish gifts from the hallowed sanctuary of the Church, a poignant rejection of the corrupting influence of worldly wealth. Enraged by this display of defiance, Constantius summoned Liberius to Milan under the watchful gaze of his guards, seeking to bend the bishop to his will.

Apple ultimately decided that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture would not be able to effectively compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. Despite the fact that the Motorola 68040 processor offered similar capabilities to Intel's 80486 chip and could outperform it on a clock-for-clock basis, the 486 chip had the advantage of being able to be clocked at higher speeds without overheating issues. This was especially evident with the clock-doubled i486DX2, which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving IBM compatible systems a significant performance advantage over Macintosh computers. Apple's product design and engineering decisions further exacerbated the situation, as they initially restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadra models, while the 486 was more widely available to OEMs and enthusiasts building their own systems.

This fusion of influences created a unique aesthetic that set the stage for medieval art for centuries to come. The surviving relics from this period, such as illuminated manuscripts and intricately carved ivories, offer a glimpse into the craftsmanship and skill of the time. While many of the exquisite metalwork pieces have been lost to time, a few treasures like the Cross of Lothair and relics from Sutton Hoo and other hoards provide a tantalizing glimpse into this golden age of artistry.",

        "During Darwin's lifetime, his book was widely translated, but issues arose with accurately conveying concepts and metaphors, leading to biased translations influenced by the translator's personal agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping to attract suitable translators who would arrange publication with local publishers on their own. Despite welcoming the renowned naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, the German translation published in 1860 included controversial themes that Darwin had intentionally left out. Bronn's translation altered Darwin's original text, changing \"favoured races\" to \"perfected races\" and adding essays on topics such as the origin of life and religious implications, reflecting Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. After producing a second edition in 1862 based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggestions, Bronn passed away suddenly from a heart attack. Darwin then collaborated closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867.",
        "The company's steadfast dedication to excellence is evident in its unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of quality and ensuring utmost customer satisfaction.\n\nDuring the Capetian dynasty's reign, France gradually expanded its authority over the nobility, starting from the Île-de-France and extending control over more regions in the 11th and 12th centuries. The Capetians faced formidable competition from the Dukes of Normandy, particularly under the rule of William the Conqueror (duke from 1035 to 1087), who successfully conquered England in 1066 and established a cross-channel empire that endured in various forms throughout the Middle Ages. In addition to their presence in England, the Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, with Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) founding a duchy in 1059 that later evolved into the Kingdom of Sicily. Subsequently, under the Angevin dynasty led by Henry II (r. 1154–1189) and his son Richard I (r. 1189–1199), the English monarchs held sway over both England and extensive territories in France that had been acquired through Henry II's familial connections.",

        "Vladimir, once prince of Novgorod, found himself thrust into a world of betrayal and bloodshed when his father passed away in 972. The venomous claws of power had ensnared his half-brother Yaropolk, who sought to claim dominion over Rus by murdering their brother Oleg. Fleeing to the icy lands of Scandinavia in 976, Vladimir sought refuge among the towering fjords and snow-capped peaks. With the aid of his noble kinsman, Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir marshaled a fierce Viking army that roared like thunder as it descended upon Novgorod and Kiev, reclaiming his birthright from the clutches of treachery. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir embarked on a monumental quest to bring light to the shadows of pagan worship that shrouded Kievan Rus'. The chronicles speak of a momentous decision that forever changed the course of history - when Vladimir, standing at the crossroads of tradition and transformation, dispatched his most esteemed advisors and warriors as emissaries to the far corners of Europe.

As the iron grip of Franco's regime tightened, political parties were silenced, unions crushed, and voices of dissent extinguished. The vibrant heartbeat of Galician culture was stifled, with the Seminario de Estudos Galegos falling silent. The air was heavy with the scent of fear and the echoes of injustice, as thousands met their end at the hands of a ruthless regime. Among the fallen were not just names on a list, but the very soul of a people - republicans, communists, nationalists, socialists, and anarchists.

        "Most fatty acids are considered non-essential as the body can produce them as needed, typically from other fatty acids, albeit requiring energy expenditure. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be obtained through diet. Maintaining an appropriate balance of these essential fatty acids, namely omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, is believed to be important for overall health, although conclusive experimental evidence is lacking. Both omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are utilized as substrates for prostaglandins, a class of eicosanoids with various roles in the body, akin to hormones. For instance, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can be synthesized in the body from the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) or obtained from marine food sources. EPA serves as a precursor for series 3 prostaglandins, such as weakly inflammatory PGE3. On the other hand, omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) acts as a precursor for series 1 prostaglandins.",
        "Public priests in ancient Rome were no ordinary individuals - they were chosen by the collegia, entrusted with eternal divine authority, and bestowed with lifelong influence, privilege, and immunity. The laws of both civil and religious realms dictated the limited number and types of religious offices one could hold, creating a sacred and traditional web of governance. These priests were not in it for the money - they received no stipend and were expected to fund the cult activities themselves, regardless of financial hardships. It was a prestigious and costly honor to serve as a priest, usually attained after a lifetime of military and political service. The path to permanent priesthood was paved with dedication, sacrifice, and a deep sense of duty.",

        "Darwin was diligently working on his comprehensive work on Natural Selection, commonly referred to as his \"big book,\" when on 18 June 1858, he received a package from Wallace, who was residing on the Maluku Islands (specifically Ternate and Gilolo). The package contained twenty pages outlining an evolutionary mechanism, in response to Darwin's previous encouragement, along with a request for Darwin to forward it to Lyell if he deemed it valuable. This mechanism bore similarities to Darwin's own theory. In a letter to Lyell, Darwin expressed that Wallace's work had \"forestalled\" his own, acknowledging that any originality he may have had would now be overshadowed. Lyell and Hooker concurred that a joint publication combining Wallace's pages with excerpts from Darwin's earlier writings should be presented at the Linnean Society. Consequently, on 1 July 1858, the joint papers were presented under the title \"On the Tendency of Species.\"",

        "In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, there was a noticeable shift in the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general public. Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686) marked a pivotal moment in this trend, as it was one of the first works to present scientific concepts in a way that was accessible and engaging for the layperson. Specifically targeting women with an interest in science, Fontenelle's book paved the way for a new genre of popular science writing that aimed to entertain as well as educate.\n\nFollowing in Fontenelle's footsteps, Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was promoted as a groundbreaking text that would provide readers with \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" This emphasis on simplicity and clarity in scientific communication was a departure from the dense and convoluted academic publications of the time. Similarly, Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (1738) and Émilie du Châtelet's posthumous translation of Newton's Principia (1756) played crucial roles in making Newtonian physics more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nFrancesco Algarotti, another key figure in the popularization of science, further contributed to this movement by translating scientific ideas into a format that was both understandable and engaging for non-specialists. Together, these works helped to bridge the gap between the scientific elite and the general public, democratizing knowledge and fostering a greater appreciation for the wonders of the natural world.",
        "The paragraph provides a concise historical overview of Iran's transformation from its indigenous faiths to Islam, and subsequently from Sunni to Shia Islam, under various ruling dynasties. The language used is clear and informative, effectively conveying the key points of each period in Iran's history. However, a critical lens can be applied to further enhance the analysis.\n\nThe structure of the paragraph could be improved by providing more detailed explanations and analyses of the impacts of these religious and political transformations on Iranian society. For example, how did the conversion to Islam affect the social structure and cultural practices of the Iranian people? What were the political motivations behind the Safavid Dynasty's conversion to Twelver Shia Islam, and how did this shape Iran's relationship with other Muslim-majority countries?\n\nFurthermore, the language used in the paragraph could be more nuanced and sophisticated to engage readers on a deeper level. By incorporating more specific examples of influential figures or events during each historical period, the argument can be strengthened and made more compelling. Additionally, the use of descriptive language and vivid imagery can help paint a more vivid picture of the historical context in which these transformations took place.\n\nOverall, by delving deeper into the structural, linguistic, and argumentative aspects of the paragraph, a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of Iran's history can be presented to readers. This will not only enhance the effectiveness of the writing but also provide a more engaging and thought-provoking exploration of the topic at hand.",
        "A government report from 2002, as covered by The Guardian, revealed that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence conducted secret germ warfare tests on the public, turning large parts of the country into a testing ground. These tests involved the release of potentially harmful chemicals and micro-organisms over vast areas without public knowledge. The Ministry of Defence asserts that the trials were intended to simulate germ warfare and were harmless. However, families residing in test areas have reported an increase in birth defects and physical and mental disabilities among their children. Many of these families are now calling for a public inquiry into the matter. The report estimates that millions of people were impacted by these tests, with one specific period from 1961 to 1968 seeing over a million individuals along the south coast of England exposed to bacteria such as e.coli and bacillus globigii, a substance that mimics anthrax.",

        "Feynman's groundbreaking diagrams of particles dancing in spacetime not only captured the essence of physics, but also ignited a fire within his soul. With each spin and interaction carefully calculated, he delved deeper into the mysteries of the universe, seeking to unravel the secrets of the fundamental forces at play.\n\nAs he delved into the realm of strong interactions, Feynman's mind raced with possibilities, culminating in the creation of the parton model. This revolutionary concept, born out of his collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann, sought to shed light on the intricate dance of nucleons scattering. However, not everyone was quick to embrace this new theory; Gell-Mann dismissed Feynman's partons as mere \"put-ons\", casting a shadow over their relationship.\n\nAmidst the skepticism and uncertainty of the 1960s, Feynman's belief in the existence of quarks never wavered. While many viewed quarks as nothing more than mathematical constructs, Feynman saw them as the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe. The Omega-minus particle's perplexing statistics only fueled his determination, driving him to seek answers in the depths of the Stanford linear accelerator.\n\nJust as Rutherford's experiments had shattered the traditional understanding of atomic structure, the deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s would shake the very foundations of particle physics. For Feynman, this was not just a scientific endeavor; it was a journey of the heart and soul, a quest to uncover the truth hidden within the fabric of the cosmos. And in that quest, he would leave an indelible mark on the world of physics, forever changing our understanding of the universe.",

        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were primarily based on medicinal folklore, with mixtures containing antimicrobial properties used in ancient cultures such as the Egyptians and Greeks over 2000 years ago. Observations of antibiosis between microorganisms in laboratory settings eventually led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur noted the potential therapeutic benefits of intervening in the antagonism between bacteria. The term 'antibiosis' was coined by French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin to describe the phenomenon exhibited by early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first observed in bacteria in 1877 by Louis Pasteur.",

        "In the midst of this turbulent era, Scotland stood as a bastion of independence, a realm untouched by the tumult that plagued its neighbors. However, the winds of change swept across the land in 1603, when the King of Scotland ascended to the English throne, and by extension, the Crown of Ireland as well. The ensuing 17th century was a cauldron of political strife, religious discord, and bloody conflict. The seeds of English colonialism planted in Ireland during the previous century now bore bitter fruit, as both Scottish and English settlers established colonies in Ulster. The religious fault lines deepened, fueling the flames of conflict as the English monarch clashed with parliament over matters of faith, particularly his stance on Catholicism. The resulting maelstrom of the English Civil War, also known as the War of the Three Kingdoms, birthed a revolutionary republic in England, while Ireland, a predominantly Catholic land, remained steadfast in its loyalty to the crown. The aftermath of the conflict saw a seismic shift in land ownership, as vast estates once held by loyalist Irish nobility were redistributed to English commoners who had fought for the parliamentary cause. This redistribution laid the foundation for a new ruling class, the Ascendancy, which would gradually erode the influence of both the English settlers and the indigenous Gaelic Irish population over the course of the next century.",
        "By the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom had blossomed into the formidable Maratha Empire, with the Peshwas at its helm. The year 1737 marked a pivotal moment in their history, as the Marathas emerged victorious in the Battle of Delhi, vanquishing a Mughal army on their home turf. The triumph fueled their ambition, spurring them on to further military conquests against the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and even the Durrani Empire, as they sought to expand their domain. Gordon vividly detailed the Marathas' strategic approach, painting a picture of calculated dominance. Beginning with annual raids, they would gradually tighten their grip on new territories, exacting tribute from villages and towns while the Mughal Empire's influence waned. The case of the Malwa region exemplified their methodical rise to power, culminating in a meticulously structured system of governance renowned for its precision. As the Marathas restored order and prosperity to once war-torn districts, their revenue surpassed pre-raid levels, cementing their reputation as shrewd administrators with an eye for detail.",

The country's swift implementation of market reforms quickly propelled it to the forefront of the former COMECON region. Drawing inspiration from the renowned economist Milton Friedman, Estonia blazed a trail by adopting a flat tax system in 1994, setting a uniform rate of 26% regardless of income level. This groundbreaking move was just the beginning of a series of tax reductions, with rates dropping to 24% in 2005, 23% in 2006, and eventually reaching 21% by 2008. In a momentous decision, the Government of Estonia unveiled the design of its euro coins in late 2004, leading to the official adoption of the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2011, albeit slightly delayed due to persistent inflationary pressures. Notably, Estonia also imposes a Land Value Tax, uniquely earmarked for local municipalities, with all revenue directed towards supporting community initiatives. The precise rate of this state-level tax is meticulously determined by...",

The precedent for this layout was established by the Remington No. 2 typewriter, introduced in 1878 as the first to feature a shift key. Notably, early mechanical typewriters omitted the characters 0 and 1, substituting O for 0 and l for 1 instead. However, as 0 and 1 became more prevalent, the standard pairing of 1! and 0) emerged. In the ASCII encoding system, characters such as !\"#$% were systematically placed in the second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The incorporation of parentheses was a nuanced challenge, as their placement could not align with 9 and 0 due to the space character occupying the position for 0. To address this, the underscore character was omitted from the arrangement.",
        "During adolescence, individuals experience a significant shift in their familial role. Young children often assert themselves assertively, yet lack the ability to influence family decisions until early adolescence. At this stage, parents begin to view their children as equals, presenting adolescents with the challenge of balancing increasing independence with maintaining a caring relationship with their parents. The onset of puberty typically brings about heightened parent-child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond, often revolving around minor issues such as curfews, clothing choices, and privacy rights. These disagreements may stem from the adolescent's newfound social influences, particularly from friends and social media, which may conflict with parental values. As a result, parent-adolescent disagreements tend to increase as external influences play a more significant role in shaping the adolescent's beliefs and behaviors.",

        "The exploration of feelings and identity within peer groups is a crucial aspect of adolescent development, as it allows individuals to refine their social skills and better understand their own self-concept. However, while peer groups can offer valuable opportunities for growth and self-discovery, they also present risks and challenges that can hinder an individual's development. The influence of peers, both positive and negative, plays a significant role in shaping adolescents' behaviors and attitudes.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that while peer groups can foster empathy, sharing, and leadership skills, they can also instigate detrimental behaviors such as substance abuse, vandalism, and theft through peer pressure. The susceptibility to negative influences peaks during early adolescence and gradually decreases with age. Therefore, it is crucial for adolescents to critically evaluate the impact of their peer group dynamics on their personal growth and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while peer groups can provide a supportive environment for adolescents to explore their identities and social skills, they can also pose risks and challenges that may hinder their development. It is essential for individuals to be mindful of the influence of their peers and to make conscious choices that align with their values and goals. By fostering self-awareness and resilience, adolescents can navigate peer relationships more effectively and cultivate positive influences that promote their overall growth and well-being.",

        "The concept of Mary's Immaculate Conception, though originating later among Latin and Frankish theologians, blossomed and flourished among Byzantine scholars who drew inspiration from Gregory Nazianzen's profound Mariology in the vibrant tapestry of the Medieval or Byzantine East. It was in the poetic verses and theological musings of luminaries like Emperor Justinian I that Mary was affectionately referred to as \"prepurified,\" a term that resonated deeply in the hearts of believers. However, it was Sophronius of Jerusalem who delved deeper into the mystery, unveiling the truth that the Theotokos was already immaculate, her purity shining brightly even before the angel's Annunciation. This revelation, that Mary was holier than even John the Baptist, a man sanctified from his mother's womb, was a testament to her unparalleled grace and sanctity. St. John Damascene, in his own eloquent words, further embellished this divine narrative by attributing to Mary the profound ability to purify the waters of baptism with a mere touch, solidifying her status as a vessel of purity and grace. In the intricate tapestry of theological discourse, these luminaries painted a portrait of Mary's immaculate nature that continues to captivate and inspire believers to this day.",

        "Although Ottoman madaris had a variety of branches of study, including calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, their primary function was to serve as Islamic centers for spiritual learning. \"The ultimate goal of all knowledge, particularly in the spiritual sciences, is the attainment of knowledge of God.\" Religion plays a central role in determining the significance and value of each field of study. As noted by İnalcık, \"Sciences that assist in the understanding of religion are deemed beneficial, whereas disciplines like astrology are considered detrimental.\" Even disciplines such as mathematics and logic, which were part of the madrasa curriculum, were taught with a religious focus. There was a spiritual undertone to the teaching of mathematics, as it was believed to help in the revelation of divine truths. İnalcık also points out that the Ottoman Ulema held the belief that rejecting logic and mathematics was misguided, as these disciplines trained the mind in proper reasoning and aided in the comprehension of divine knowledge. Even the study of philosophy was restricted within the madrasas, emphasizing the importance of its alignment with religious principles.",

As the Roman Empire expanded, Galicia was incorporated into its vast territory following the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, eventually becoming a Roman province by the 3rd century AD. The land saw a series of transitions, from the Germanic Suebi establishing a kingdom in Braga in 410, to being incorporated into the Visigoth kingdom in 585.

By 1801, Toussaint Louverture had assumed the role of de facto ruler, wielding dictatorial power over the island. When the Treaty of Amiens was signed, Napoleon seized the opportunity to reclaim the once-prosperous colony. Despite the National Convention's decision to abolish slavery in 1794, Napoleon made concessions to the British in the treaty, agreeing not to abolish slavery in colonies where the decree had not been enforced.

In his contemplation of the circumcision of Jesus and Mary, Gregory coined the term \"prokathartheisa\" to describe Mary as \"prepurified.\" He saw both Jesus and Mary as equally holy, both bathed in the light of grace and glory. Gregory's insights into Mary's purification were likely influenced by the growing reverence for the Mother of God in Constantinople, especially during the festive season of Christmas.

But their perseverance paid off as they emerged in the plains of Northern Italy, catching the Austrians by surprise.

This tale is often associated with an impossible task, akin to that of Sisyphus, and the name itself may have roots in the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) term *danu, meaning \"river\". Despite various interpretations, there is no definitive explanation for the origin of the Danaans. Some scholars have suggested a connection between the Danaans and the Denyen, a group of the Sea Peoples who launched attacks on Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). An inscription from this period also references the Weshesh, possibly identified as the Achaeans. The Denyen are thought to have been inhabitants of the city of Adana in Cilicia, with archaeological evidence suggesting similarities in pottery styles.",

        "Some rock musicians today wield mandolins like fiery weapons on stage, their fingers dancing along the single strings of electric models that crackle with electric energy. Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys is a master of this unconventional instrument, using its sharp, cutting sound to add an edge to the band's music. When he plucks the mandolin, its metallic twang slices through the air, blending with the wail of the tin whistle and the haunting drone of the Great Highland bagpipes. The combination creates a cacophony of sound that is both primal and electrifying, a fusion of ancient Celtic traditions and modern punk rock energy.

        "Predators and prey dance a delicate tango in the intricate web of nature. The majestic blue jay, with its vibrant plumage and piercing gaze, swoops down to hunt insects, only to become a tantalizing target for cunning cats and slithering snakes. These serpents, in turn, may find themselves soaring through the skies as a hawk's meal. The chain of life is woven tightly, each organism playing its part in the eternal cycle of consumption.\n\nIn the realm of predators, there exists a hierarchy of power. At the base are the herbivores, gentle grazers of the land who sustain themselves on the bounty of the sun. They are the primary consumers, the foundation of the trophic pyramid. Above them lurk the carnivores, the ruthless hunters who feast on the flesh of their fellow creatures. Among them are the secondary consumers, preying on those below them with ruthless efficiency.\n\nBut the chain does not end there. There are tertiary consumers, and even beyond them, quartary consumers, each one feeding on the one before. Yet, as energy diminishes with each transfer, the pyramid narrows, reaching its peak at only five or six levels. Rarely does it ascend higher, with most predators confined to just three trophic levels.\n\nIn the wild savannas of Africa, a lion prowls, stalking its prey with silent grace. It is a creature of power and majesty, a symbol of the apex predator. Yet even the lion, with all its strength and cunning, is bound by the laws of nature. In the grand tapestry of life, every predator has its place, every prey its role. And in this delicate balance, the circle of life continues, unbroken and eternal.",
