{"original": [" Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . \n", " Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 \u2013 6 kilograms ( 11 \u2013 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 \u2013 38 cm ( 9 \u2013 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 \u2013 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 \u2013 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 \u2013 2 years for larger animals . \n", " The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . \n", " The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . \n", " The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : \n", " Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 \u2013 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 \u2013 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . Females carrying eggs are said to be \" berried \" and can be found throughout the year . \n", " The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 \u2013 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . \n", " Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . \n", " The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the \" midnight @-@ sun lobster \" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . \n", " Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there . \n", " Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 \u2013 150 metres ( 0 \u2013 492 ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . \n", " Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the bacterium <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . \n", " Homarus gammarus is traditionally \" highly esteemed \" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \" The <unk> \" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \" excellent \" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \" sand vein \" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . \n", " Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . \n", " H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including Astacus marinus Fabricius , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . \n", " The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by <unk> Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 \u00b0 53 \u2032 N 11 \u00b0 32 \u2032 E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . \n", " Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam , CB , CBE ( 15 July 1914 \u2013 23 December 1976 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born and educated in Tasmania , he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934 . He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the outbreak of World War II . In April 1941 , he became commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron , which operated Lockheed Hudsons . The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December , and saw action against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific . After returning to Australia in February 1942 , Headlam held staff appointments and training commands , finishing the war a group captain . \n", " Headlam served as Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in 1946 , and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950 . In 1950 \u2013 51 , during the Malayan Emergency , he was stationed at Singapore as commander of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing and , later , RAF Tengah . He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel , in 1957 and 1959 \u2013 60 , receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 . Promoted air vice marshal , he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command in 1961 \u2013 62 , AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia \u2013 Malaysia Konfrontasi , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1965 \u2013 66 , and AOC Support Command in 1966 \u2013 67 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1965 . Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971 , he retired from the Air Force and died in Melbourne five years later . \n", " The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam , Frank Headlam was born on 15 July 1914 in Launceston , Tasmania . He was schooled at <unk> College , Hobart , and matriculated in 1932 . Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934 . He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( FTS ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935 . \n", " After completing a conversion course , Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre @-@ war RAAF , Seaplane Squadron was part of No. 1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes , among other types . During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with \" strong air forces , naval forces ( including submarines ) , and fixed defences , Australia may be made practically invulnerable \" . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , this paper \" in effect , defined the ' anti @-@ lodgment ' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking \" . \n", " Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 FTS . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . Commencing in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve @-@ day , 10 @,@ 800 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 700 mi ) round @-@ Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November . The following month , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a flight commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before transferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . \n", " Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south @-@ eastern Australia . Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15 January 1940 , when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer . On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul 's Anglican Church in Frankston ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . \n", " Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941 , and raised to wing commander on 1 July . Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons , the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December , when four of its aircraft were ordered to Darwin , Northern Territory , in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific . On 7 December , this detachment established itself at Penfui , near Koepang in Dutch Timor , while No. 2 Squadron 's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby . The following day , aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific , one of the Penfui @-@ based Hudsons attacked the Japanese <unk> Nanyo Maru , which was suspected of being a radio ship , and forced it aground . By 12 December , Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base , as well as No. 2 Squadron . \n", " During January 1942 , No. 2 Squadron 's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui , <unk> Island , and Darwin . The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of Celebes . Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros . Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft . The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia . On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from Sparrow Force . He returned to Darwin the following day , just as the city experienced its first raid by the Japanese . Four of No. 2 Squadron 's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters , where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor . \n", " Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until 12 May 1942 , when he was posted to Nhill , Victoria , as commanding officer of No. 2 Air Navigation School , operating Ansons . No. 97 ( Reserve ) Squadron was formed from the school 's personnel in June . On 20 July 1943 , Headlam took command of No. 2 Air Observer School ( <unk> ) , also operating Ansons , at Mount Gambier , South Australia . He was promoted to group captain on 1 December 1943 , and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 <unk> , operating Ansons and Fairey Battles out of Port Pirie , on 9 December . After handing over command of No. 3 <unk> , he commenced studies at RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha , Victoria , on 2 October 1944 . He was appointed senior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command on 12 January 1945 . \n", " Headlam became Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in January 1946 . Posted to Britain at the end of the year , he attended the Royal Air Force Staff College , Andover , and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London . On his return to Australia , in November 1947 , he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters . In November 1950 , Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan . Headquartered at RAF Changi , Singapore , No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency : No. 1 ( Bomber ) Squadron , flying Avro Lincolns , and No. 38 ( Transport ) Squadron , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist @-@ held territory , as well as strikes against pinpoint targets . The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights , VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia , and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo , dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets . Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December , when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co @-@ piloting on a supply drop crash @-@ landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang , following engine failure . In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah , Singapore , in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing . Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951 . \n", " On 19 February 1952 , Headlam became senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith , New South Wales . During his term as SASO , the RAAF began re @-@ equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters . The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change , as it transitioned from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system to one based on function , resulting in the establishment of Home ( operational ) , Training , and Maintenance Commands . Eastern Area Command , considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control , was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953 . Headlam was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his \" exceptional ability and devotion to duty \" . He was promoted to acting air commodore in May . His appointment as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954 . \n", " Headlam was promoted to substantive air commodore on 1 January 1955 . In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia , he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air , Canberra , from 19 March to 21 October 1957 , between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Walters , and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960 , between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely . In this role Headlam occupied a seat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee , chaired by businessman William John Allison , examining conditions of defence service ; the committee 's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay , among other improvements . Headlam 's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959 , and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959 . The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF 's Directorate of Intelligence . Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1958 Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June . In May 1960 he became acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . \n", " On 30 January 1961 , Headlam joined the staff of Operational Command ( OPCOM ) , the successor organisation to Home Command , responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units . He took over as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock in April . Headlam was promoted to air vice marshal on 29 May . On 17 July 1962 , he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaya , and took up the appointment of AOC No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later . He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch . As AOC No. 224 Group , Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962 , and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month . Divorced from his first wife in 1956 , he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964 . He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November . \n", " Returning to Australia , Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) \" in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories \" on 22 June . His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia . The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term , and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment . The year before , Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch , the Chief of the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy . Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbourne , on 8 August 1966 . Support Command had been formed in 1959 , by merging the RAAF 's former Training and Maintenance Commands . On 1 January 1968 , Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff . He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971 . \n", " Returning to Australia in June 1971 , Headlam took resettlement leave before retiring from the Air Force on 3 August . He made his home in Melbourne , where he died aged 62 on 23 December 1976 , after a lengthy battle with cancer . Survived by his children and his second wife , he was given a private funeral and cremated at Springvale Crematorium . \n", " M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between Fremont and Howard City . The section between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s . Various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past . The current route was finalized in the late 1970s \n", " M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont . This junction is at a tripoint of county lines . M @-@ 120 forms the north \u2013 south Newaygo \u2013 Oceana and Newaygo \u2013 Muskegon county lines . B @-@ 96 , which forms the east \u2013 west Oceana \u2013 Muskegon county line runs due west of the intersection . M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east . The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont . The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town . The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land . As the trunkline approaches Newaygo , the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River . M @-@ 82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 . The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street . South of downtown , M @-@ 82 turns east again , independent of M @-@ 37 , and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the Manistee National Forest . The east end of M @-@ 82 is at exit 118 on US 131 / M @-@ 46 west of Howard City . \n", " The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ 532 vehicles daily . The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ 018 vehicles east of Newaygo . In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . \n", " The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , shortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . \n", " Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County . M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of Hesperia , to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia . M @-@ 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City . M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 . The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current highway routing . \n", " Shikamaru Nara ( <unk> <unk> , Nara Shikamaru ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto .

Merchandise based on Shikamaru has been released , including action figures , key chains , and patches . \n", " Masashi Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius , and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha 's intelligent but abrasive personality . Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl , noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life . When designing Shikamaru 's Part II appearance , Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series .

Contrary to his lazy tendencies , Shikamaru is extremely intelligent ; his teacher , Asuma Sarutobi , determined that Shikamaru 's IQ was over 200 . Shikamaru 's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Technique ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , English TV : \" Shadow Possession Jutsu \" ) , the signature technique of his clan , with which he merges his shadow with an opponent 's shadow , making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru 's movements . As the series progresses , Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways .

CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Shikamaru as one of his favorite characters from Naruto . \n", " Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have commented on Shikamaru 's character . IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series , and referred to him as \" the poster child for any card @-@ carrying member of Generation X \" due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential . In a review of episode 110 , IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair . Anime News Network also commented on this development , calling Shikamaru 's emergence as \" an unlikely hero \" one of the highlights of the arc . In a subsequent review of episode 135 , in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru 's team were critically injured , IGN lauded the \" great moment \" in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover , and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends . Mania Entertainment 's Justin Rich celebrated his \" sheer intellect \" , calling him \" one of the most fascinating characters in the series \" and \" one of the few truly brilliant fighters in sh\u014dnen anime \" . Dani Moure , another reviewer from the same site , noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was \" one of the better fights involving the supporting players \" . \n", " Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of Mississippi , in the United States .

NAS Meridian is home to the Regional Counter @-@ Drug Training Academy ( <unk> ) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state . Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key , who set a world endurance flight record in 1935 .

Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non @-@ military employer in the region , employing 2 @,@ 610 people . \n", " Among the city 's many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center , the Meridian Museum of Art , Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries , one for whites and one for African Americans . The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era . \n", " The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . Jimmie Rodgers , the \" Father of Country Music \" , was born in Meridian . Highland Park houses a museum which displays memorabilia of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . The park is also home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel , a National Historic Landmark . It is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence . Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin , James Chaney \u2013 an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 , and Hartley Peavey , founder of Peavey Electronics headquartered in Meridian . The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966 @-@ 1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing . \n", " Previously inhabited by the Choctaw Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian Removal . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . \n", " After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , Richard McLemore , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of McLemore 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from Kemper County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . Ragsdale and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . \n", " There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name \" Meridian , \" believing the term to be synonymous with \" junction \" ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred \" <unk> \" ( meaning \" mad river \" in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and Ragsdale proposed \" Ragsdale City . \" Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad \u2013 the sign on which would alternate between \" Meridian \" and \" <unk> \" each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left \" Meridian \" on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . \n", " Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William Tecumseh Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , \" Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and cantonments no longer exists . \" Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . \n", " The town boomed in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its \" Golden Age \" from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the Wechsler School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . \n", " The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to \" provide luxury to the common man , \" opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal courthouse was built in 1933 as a WPA project . \n", " After a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . \n", " During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James Chaney and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , Chaney , <unk> , and Goodman went to Neshoba County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . \n", " Seven Klansmen , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \" depriving the victims of their civil rights \" and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted \" a white official in a civil rights killing . \" In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . \n", " Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . \n", " Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . \" \n", " After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown . \n", " Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its \" Golden Age , \" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . \n", " As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . \n", " The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . \n", " As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . Rehabilitation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events . \n", " Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts , the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District .

The store has been selling fine men 's and women 's clothing since 1887 , when the store was first opened by Alex Loeb . \n", " Known for more than a century of arts , Meridian contains many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events . One of the first art organizations in the city , The Meridian Art League , was established in February 1933 . Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian , but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949 , exhibitions were held at various locations around the city . After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed , the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits . The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults . Over thirty exhibitions are held annually , ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials , photography , crafts , and many other works of art . The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits , 20th century photography , and several sculptures . \n", " The Meridian Council for the Arts ( MCA ) was founded as Meridian 's and Lauderdale County 's official arts agency in 1978 . MCA operates its Community Art Grants program , the annual <unk> Festival , several workshops , and other special events each year . MCA is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art , the Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian Little Theatre , one of the South 's oldest subscription @-@ based community theatres , was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County , entertaining over 22 @,@ 000 guests each season , making it Mississippi 's most @-@ attended community theatre . The Meridian Symphony Orchestra ( <unk> ) \u2013 founded in 1961 \u2013 played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963 . In 1965 the <unk> booked its first international soloist , Elena <unk> , to perform with the orchestra . The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus . The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard , who has been with the orchestra since 1991 . The <unk> will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman . \n", " The city 's former Grand Opera House was built in 1889 by two half brothers , Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg . During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works , the first being a German company 's rendition of Johann Strauss II 's \" The Gypsy Baron \" . After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression , the opera house was abandoned for nearly 70 years . A $ 10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation , a local foundation chartered in 1998 , sparked the building 's restoration while $ 15 million came from a combination of city , county , and federal grants . The opera house 's renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name \" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts . \" The Riley Center , which includes a 950 @-@ seat auditorium for live performances , a 200 @-@ seat studio theater , and 30 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 2 @,@ 787 m2 ) of meeting space , attracts more than 60 @,@ 000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences , meetings , and performances . \n", " Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure trove being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century . Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss , famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building . Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his <unk> Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino . One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills . \n", " Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in 2001 and in 2006 promised $ 4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $ 8 million . The city donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the cause in September 2007 . The <unk> , as proposed , would be located on 175 acres ( 71 ha ) at Bonita Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre , an indoor concert hall , and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists . The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana 's building . That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $ 300 @,@ 000 . In February 2009 , the <unk> revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame . The first star on the walk was dedicated to Jimmie Rodgers , a Meridian native . In September of the same year , the second star was revealed , recognizing B.B. King , a famous blues musician from Mississippi . On June 1 , 2010 , authors Tennessee Williams , Eudora Welty , and William Faulkner were added to the walk . Sela Ward was added to the walk on June 24 , 2010 . The <unk> plans to add many more Mississippi @-@ born stars to the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman , Jimmy Buffett , Elvis Presley , Conway Twitty , and others . \n", " Another location in the city used for large productions is the <unk> Shrine Temple Theater . The Temple Theater houses a 778 @-@ pipe Robert Morgan organ , one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state . With seating for 1800 persons , the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple . At the time , it was one of the largest stages in the United States , second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City . Today , seating 1576 persons , the Temple is used year @-@ round for area events , live stage shows , plays , concerts , <unk> Shrine functions , and public screenings of classic movies . \n", " Highland Park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum which displays the original guitar of \" The Singing Brakeman \" and other memorabilia of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . In addition to the museum building itself , there are outside memorials , and a vintage steam locomotive on display . A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi . The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta . Also , a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of Rodgers on June 1 , 2010 . Each year since 1953 , the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death . \n", " The park is also home to a 19th @-@ century carousel manufactured around 1895 by Gustav Dentzel of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Highland Park Dentzel Carousel has been in operation since 1909 , is a National Historic Landmark , and is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence . Its house is the only remaining original carousel building built from a Dentzel blueprint . Around Town <unk> <unk> is a public arts project of 62 carousel horses , representing the historic carousel . Sixty @-@ two pieces have been sponsored by local businesses and citizens , and design of the horses was conceived and painted by local artists . They are placed throughout the city and county . \n", " The city contains several recreational parks , including Highland Park , Bonita Lakes , and <unk> Lake . Highland Park contains picnic shelters , swimming pools , tennis courts , a baseball field , softball fields , and a playground , all open year round to visitors . Bonita Lakes is a city @-@ owned , 3 @,@ 300 @-@ acre ( 13 km2 ) park including three lakes . The park also includes the Long Creek Reservoir and Lakeview Municipal Golf Course , along with nature trails , a jogging and walking track , biking paths , horseback riding trails , pavilions , picnic facilities , boat ramps , paddle boats , concessions , and fishing . Along with the lakes , the Bonita Lakes area includes Bonita Lakes Mall , Bonita Lakes Crossing , and Bonita Lakes Plaza . <unk> Lake is a 7 @,@ 150 @-@ acre ( 28 @.@ 9 km2 ) establishment containing a 4 @,@ 144 @-@ acre ( 16 @.@ 77 km2 ) lake which offers boating , fishing , swimming , water skiing , picnicking , hunting , hiking and camping .

The organization is a member of the National Congress of State Games , which is affiliated with the U.S. Olympic Committee . In its first year 1 @,@ 200 athletes competed in twelve sports , and since then over 70 @,@ 000 athletes have participated in the Games . In 2009 , more than 4500 athletes participated in 27 sports . All competitors in the games can compete in the Southeast Sports Festival while medalists may move up to the bi @-@ annual State Games of America . \n", " Originally the games were held in one weekend in June , but as more sports were added , the event was expanded to two weekends . Opening ceremonies always begin on the 3rd Friday of June in downtown Meridian . The games are held at several sports parks , including Northeast Park , <unk> Davidson Complex , and other various fields throughout the city . Northeast Park is an 85 @-@ acre ( 34 ha ) park on Highway 39 that contains ten tennis courts , four softball fields , three soccer fields , an asphalt track , and a large picnic pavilion . The <unk> Davidson Sports Complex includes six tennis courts , four softball fields , and a half @-@ mile track . Other sports fields include the Meridian Jaycee Soccer Complex , Sykes Park , and Phil Hardin Park . \n", " There are also several golf courses in the city , including the aforementioned Lakeview Municipal Golf Course , an 18 @-@ hole course open to the public daily . Briarwood County Club , located on Highway 39 North , is a private club with golf , swimming , fishing , and dining facilities . Other golf courses serving the city include Northwood Country Club , <unk> Creek Golf Center , and Ponta Creek Golf Course . \n", " Amtrak 's Crescent line connects Meridian with the cities of New York , New York ; Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; Baltimore , Maryland ; Washington , D.C. ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; Atlanta , Georgia ; Birmingham , Alabama ; and New Orleans , Louisiana . The Union Station Multi @-@ Modal Transportation Center ( <unk> ) is located at 1901 Front Street , part of the Meridian Downtown Historic District , which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Originally built in 1906 , but later demolished in 1966 then rebuilt in 1997 , the station includes several modes of transportation including the Meridian Transit System , Amtrak , Norfolk Southern rail corridor , Greyhound buses , Trailways and other providers of transit services . The number of passengers on Amtrak trains , Greyhound buses , and Meridian Transit System buses averages 242 @,@ 360 per year . \n", " The city is served by Meridian Regional Airport , located at Key Field , <unk> Airport Boulevard South , 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) southwest of the city . At 10 @,@ 004 foot ( 3 @,@ 049 m ) , the airport 's runway is the longest public runway in Mississippi . The airport , which has been in service since 1930 , offers daily flights to Dallas / Fort Worth , TX . \n", " During the Great Depression , residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance , but in 1935 Brothers Fred and Al Key , managers of the airport , thought of a way to keep the airport operating . From June 4 until July 1 , 1935 , the brothers flew over the city in their plane , the \" Ole Miss . \" The record they established in their 27 days aloft , totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes , attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running . Key Field is therefore named after the brothers , whose flight endurance record remains unbroken in conventional flight . \n", " Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools . From this bond , the Wechsler School was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks . \n", " From this early district and later additions , the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools . The city also contains several private schools including Lamar School , Calvary Christian School , Community Christian School , and St. Patrick 's Catholic School . The campus of Meridian High School , the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 ha ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms . The school is made up of grades 10 @-@ 12 and enrolls approximately 1 @,@ 500 students . \n", " Meridian is home to two post @-@ secondary educational institutions . Meridian Community College , founded in 1937 , is located at 910 Highway 19 N and offers free tuition for four semesters to graduates from the Meridian Public and Lauderdale County School Districts as well as homeschooled children who reside inside Lauderdale County . Originally known as Meridian Junior College and located at Meridian High School , the college moved to its present location in 1965 . After desegregation laws were passed , <unk> merged with T.J. Harris Junior College in 1970 , which had previously enrolled African @-@ American students . The name change from Meridian Junior College to Meridian Community College took place In 1987 \" to more accurately reflect the diversity of opportunities it provides for a growing community area . \" Mississippi State University also operates a campus in the city . As of the Fall 2008 semester , 763 students from 33 counties throughout the state and several in Alabama attended the college . \n", " Meridian is served by the Meridian @-@ Lauderdale County Public Library , located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue . The city originally had two Carnegie libraries , both built in 1913 \u2013 one for blacks and one for whites . A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current location . The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970 , and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28 , 2008 . \n", " The only daily newspaper printed in the city is The Meridian Star , which has been in operation since 1898 .

Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828 hectares ( 3 @.@ 2 square miles ) , Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland . Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation . \n", " The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of Duke Hakon 's 13th @-@ century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island . The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at <unk> in West Voe . Subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s . \n", " Papa Stour is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay . There are 34 kilometres ( 21 mi ) of rugged coastline which is indented by numerous small <unk> and four larger ' voes ' . <unk> Voe ( Old Norse : ' harbour bay ' ) in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch . <unk> Voe to the east ( Old Norse : ' house bay ' ) is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry 's embarkation point . \n", " <unk> Holm and Maiden Stack guard the harbour entrance to the south . The former is a tidal island and was a leper colony until the 18th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the \" lepers \" there were suffering from a vitamin deficiency rather than leprosy ) . The latter 's name relates to a story from the 14th century . Lord Thorvald <unk> is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to \" preserve \" his daughter from men . Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped . West Voe , the inner part of which is called ' <unk> <unk> ' is the main <unk> in the north coast , the smaller <unk> Voe lying immediately to the west . \n", " The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which overlooks <unk> Voe and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill dyke ( which runs south from West Voe ) . To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf scalping ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . \n", " In addition to the larger islets mentioned above there are various other isles and skerries around the coast of Papa Stour . They include : <unk> Stack , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Skerry , <unk> Holm , <unk> Stacks , Holm of Melby , Koda Skerry , Lyra Skerry , Skerries of <unk> , Skerry of <unk> , Sula Stack , Swat Skerry , The Horn , <unk> Skerry and Wilma Skerry . The Ve Skerries lie 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to the north west . They include : <unk> , North Skerry , <unk> , <unk> and The Clubb . In between Papa Stour and Ve Skerries lies the shallow bank of Papa @-@ <unk> . \n", " On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) island of <unk> Holm ( which he has renamed \" <unk> Island \" ) made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown Dependency of <unk> . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to 1468 , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom . \n", " The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava ( rhyolite ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation . \n", " Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , cliffs , voes and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain . The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet another is ' Francie 's Hole ' close to <unk> Voe in the west . This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : \n", " Otters , grey seals , killer whales and harbour porpoises are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour . Atlantic puffin , Arctic and common tern , <unk> and Arctic skua , northern fulmar , common guillemot , razorbill , curlew , wheatear , ringed plover and great black @-@ backed gull all breed on the island , and numerous migratory species have been recorded . \n", " There is a profusion of wild flowers , including mountain everlasting , spring squill and <unk> as well as the ubiquitous heather . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation . The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred . \n", " Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped cairns ' . Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning \" Big island of the Papar \" ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west . \n", " Papa Stour is the subject of a 1299 manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland . It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke Hakon Magnusson , who was later to become King Hakon V of Norway . There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> Voe , which are the remains of a ' ting ' , or local assembly . This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord Thorvald <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called \u2018 dominus de <unk> \u2019 . ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . ) The remains of Duke Hakon 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> Voe . \n", " In 1469 Shetland came under nominal Scottish control , although the Norse ' Lairds of Norway ' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century . In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish lairds , Thomas Gifford of Busta , and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ oared boats known as <unk> . \n", " The island church , which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> kirk ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \" the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century \" . There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . \n", " In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . \n", " There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or Clack Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below . Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south Mainland of Shetland . \n", " In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. Mingulay ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . \n", " The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries .

Yet, it is only upon the completion of its transformation within the confines of the steaming pot that the true splendor of this wondrous creature unfurls.  The elusive hue of ruby that graces the creature's form once it has been subjected to the sizzling embrace of the pan, is a testament to the resilience of life. For, prior to its metamorphosis, the lobster's skin appears as a paler shade, a testament to the resplendent hues that lie dormant beneath. This change is brought about by the unyielding heat of the cooking process, as it breaks the delicate bonds that hold the red pigment, astaxanthin, in a protein complex, allowing the vibrant hue to finally reveal itself.  In its natural state, the crustacean's skin appears as a subtle interplay of blues and whites, evoking a sense of serenity and tranquility. Yet, in the face of the culinary mastery that is the act of cooking, this delicate beauty is transformed into an extravagant spectacle, the vivid reds and oranges of the cooked lobster a testament to the power of heat and the inherent potential of color.

During the sultry months of summer, the air is filled with the sweet scent of their love, as a recently moulting female, her carapace soft and vulnerable, attracts the attentions of a hard-shelled male, whose determination to mate is palpable in his persistent courtship. Mating rituals unfold in a delicate ballet of love, the male's probing nuzzles causing the female's shell to quiver with pleasure. The union brings forth a new generation, and the female carries her precious cargo for an astounding 12 months, the time frame depending on the ever-changing temperature of their environment. During this time, the female is said to be \"berried,\" her pleopods swollen with the life within. The term aptly captures the sense of wonder and mystery surrounding these resilient creatures, who can be found in quiet glades, sandy shores, and even amidst the bustling cityscape, a testament to their unwavering resilience and adaptability.", "The egg stage of this organism culminates in hatching at night, after which the hatchlings swim to the water's surface and drift with ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage, marked by three molts and lasting between 15 and 35 days, precedes the juvenile stage. Following the third molt, the juvenile takes on a more adult-like form and adopts a benthic lifestyle. However, due to their rarity in the wild and limited knowledge about their behavior, the juveniles are generally not well-documented. It has been estimated that only 1 in every 20,000 larvae survives to the benthic phase. Once the carapace length of the juvenile reaches 15 millimeters (0.059 inches), they leave their burrows and embark on their adult lives.", "The Homarus gammarus, also known as the common lobster, can be found spanning the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, stretching from the frigid waters of northern Norway to the sun-drenched shores of Morocco.

This fascinating creature can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, each with their own unique characteristics. We have the widespread population, and then there are three populations that have undergone a fascinating evolutionary shift - possibly due to adapting to their local environment. One of these populations is the infamous \"midnight sun lobster\" from the cold and remote waters of northern Norway. These lobsters are truly one-of-a-kind, and their distinct genetic makeup sets them apart from their counterparts in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans. But it doesn't stop there! In the heart of Europe, there is another population of lobsters that have also undergone a remarkable evolutionary change. Samples collected from the Dutch waters are completely separate from those found in the North Sea or English Channel, further illustrating the diversity and complexity of this fascinating species. So, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, this species is not only beautiful and intriguing, but it also holds a wealth of knowledge about the fascinating ways in which life has evolved and adapted to its environment.

He sought out the skies, seeking to prove his mettle, and his unwavering passion for aviation would lead him to the prestigious No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook in Victoria. Frank's quest for adventure and his unyielding spirit led to his commission as a pilot officer on 1st January 1935. This was a momentous occasion for him, marking the beginning of a life in the skies that would see him soar to great heights. Despite the opposition from his parents, he had made", "Headlam's journey with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began with the completion of a conversion course that led him to be assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook. Despite being classified as a flight, the squadron played a crucial role in the pre-war RAAF, operating various types of aircraft including Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes. During his tenure at the Seaplane Squadron, Headlam was promoted to the rank of flying officer on July 1, 1935. In a bold attempt to contribute to national defense, Headlam penned a paper on the subject, advocating for a strong air force, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defenses to make Australia practically invulnerable. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper \"in effect, defined the 'anti-lodgment' concept, a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking.\" Headlam's paper not only demonstrated his deep understanding of the complexities of defense strategy but also showcased his foresight into the critical importance of a well-rounded and robust air force. The legacy of his work continues to influence RAAF strategic thinking, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive defense strategy that encompasses all branches of the military and utilizes the full potential of available resources.

Rising through the ranks with grace and skill, he was promoted to the esteemed rank of Flight Lieutenant on the momentous day of March 1st, 1937. In the summer of 1938, he embarked on an odyssey of epic proportions, as one of six valiant students chosen to partake in the groundbreaking Long Specialist Navigation Course. Led by the esteemed Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook, this rigorous course demanded the ultimate in navigation and aviation skills. As the winds of change swept across the skies, Headlam found himself at the helm of a daring adventure. In the month of November, he led a daring trio of Avro Ansons on a twelve-day, 1,080-kilometer (670-mile) circumnavigation of the land down under. The journey attracted the attention of the press and public alike, and Headlam emerged as a shining star in the annals of aviation history.

The Penfui detachment engaged in a crucial battle, attacking Japanese shipping involved in the invasion of Celebes. On January 11th, two Hudsons managed to shoot down or damage three Japanese floatplanes while simultaneously bombing a transport ship. However, they faced a devastating retaliation, as both Hudsons were shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros the following day. On January 26th, Penfui Island was subjected to its first bombing attack by the Japanese, and this led to frequent raids on the base. Consequently, the intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin, while Headlam and his staff remained behind to ensure the base's continued use for reconnaissance missions from Australia. On February 18th, Headlam received orders to evacuate his personnel, except for a small demolition team, to dismantle the airfield. He returned to Darwin the next day, just as the city experienced its first assault by the Japanese. Four of No. 2 Squadron's Hudsons were destroyed in this attack, while the remaining aircraft relocated to Daly Waters, where they continued to engage in reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.", "Headlam's distinguished career at the heart of the war effort saw him stationed at the nerve center of North-Western Area Command, where he remained as Controller of Operations until May 12, 1942. Then, as if summoned by the winds of war, he was posted to the quaint town of Nhill, Victoria, to helm the No. 2 Air Navigation School, where he oversaw the operation of Ansons. As if the whirlwind of his journey had not yet subsided, he was promoted to the rank of group captain on December 1, 1943. It was around this time that he was entrusted with the responsibility of leading No. 2 Air Observer School in Mount Gambier, South Australia, where he oversaw the operation of Ansons. In yet another testament to his prowess and adaptability, he was appointed as the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3, an elite training establishment responsible for the operation of Ansons and Fairey Battles at Port Pirie. The unwavering determination and expertise displayed by Headlam in these diverse roles earned him a reputation that was both admired and respected. However, as the tide of war ebbed and flowed, Headlam knew that he must adapt yet again. He relinquished command of No. 3 and left the skies to others. In 1944, he embarked on an intensive study program at the prestigious RAAF Staff", "Headlam assumed the position of Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in January 1946. Later in the year, he was posted to Britain and attended the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover. Following his tenure there, he served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London.

During his tenure, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began re-equipping with advanced English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. To further enhance its capabilities, the Air Force underwent a significant organizational change, transitioning from a geographically based command and control system to one based on function. This led to the establishment of three major commands: Home (Operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. As a result of the preponderance of combat units under its control, Eastern Area Command was reorganized as Home Command in October 1953. For his exceptional ability and devotion to duty, Headlam was awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours.

He was later recognized for distinguished service in the Borneo Territories and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on June 22. His tenure as DCAS coincided with a significant rearmament program in the Air Force, which was the largest since World War II. This expansion and Australia's increasing involvement in South East Asia contributed to manpower shortages. The Vietnam War also saw the deployment of the first RAAF helicopters towards the end of his term. Headlam and Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, the Chief of the General Staff, visited Saigon in March 1966 to plan the deployment. Prior to this, Wilton had recommended sending two Iroquois to Vietnam for familiarization purposes, but Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, had rejected the idea, leaving the RAAF helicopter squadron underprepared for its army cooperation role. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as the Commander of AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on August 8, 1966. Support Command was formed in 1959 by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On January 1, 1968, Headlam was transferred to London as the Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He also served as an", "In June 1971, Headlam touched down in Australia, his journey through the skies now a chapter in history. A resettlement leave marked his last steps in the Air Force, and on August 3, he closed the chapter of his service, setting his roots in Melbourne.

Their grief was tempered by the love they shared, and he was laid to rest in a private funeral at Springvale Crematorium, his life now resting in the eternal embrace of the Earth.", "State Trunkline M-82 is a major roadway in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, connecting Fremont and Howard City. The portion between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and follows the southern border of Manistee National Forest. This route has been in place since the 1920s, with the first usage appearing in the Upper Peninsula in 1919. Throughout history, M-82 has undergone several extensions and truncations, with its terminus shifting as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past. The current route was finalized in the late 1970s.", "At the intersection of M @-@ 82 and M @-@ 120, which are located at the intersection of county lines, the highway begins its journey. M @-@ 120 marks the boundary between Newaygo and Muskegon counties in a north-south direction, while also serving as the Newaygo-Oceana county line. B @-@ 96, running east-west through Oceana and Muskegon counties, marks the border between the two. M @-@ 82 heads eastward from the junction, passing through rural farmland and entering the community of Fremont, where the road is now known as Main Street. It then transitions south, traveling through the downtown area and exiting the town on Stewart Avenue. As the trunkline continues, it rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street, traversing more farm land to the east. As M @-@ 82 approaches Newaygo, the surrounding terrain becomes more wooded and features the Muskegon River.

In a testament to the ceaseless ebb and flow of life along the highways, these volumes of vehicular traffic are measured and calculated in a fascinating metric known as Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT). This quantifiable measure of the flow of life along a stretch of roadway on an average day serves as an eloquent reminder of the ceaseless activity that characterizes the highways of Michigan. In 2009, the department's meticulous assessments revealed that the peak volume for the M-82 highway, a ribbon of asphalt that winds through the verdant landscape of the state, reached a staggering 16,532 vehicles daily. While this figure speaks volumes about the bustling activity of the highway, it is also a testament to the unwavering dedication of the MDOT to ensure the safety of those who traverse these roads. Conversely, the AADT figures also reveal a more contemplative aspect of the highways. The nadir of vehicular activity, a mere 4,018 vehicles daily, was recorded to the east of the bucolic town of Newaygo.

This remarkable road dates back to the year 1926, and its rich history stretches across the beautiful landscapes of Michigan. Once it began in the bustling city of Hart, the highway took travelers on an unforgettable ride, weaving through the charming towns of Ferry, Hesperia, and Fremont, eventually reaching its destination in the thriving metropolis of Shelby. In 1936, the M-82 highway underwent a transformation that would change its course forever. Late in that year, the M-46 highway was extended, creating a concurrent segment that filled a gap in the M-46 routing. This exciting new addition to the highway network left the M-82 highway with a new destination, the northern junction of M-46 and M-82 in the city of Howard City. However, the story of M-82 did not end there. In a thrilling move, the M-82 highway was relocated to a new alignment in the late 1940s, leading its travelers in a westward direction from Ferry. While the route initially headed northwesterly to Hart, it ultimately ended in the bustling city of Shelby, marking the beginning of a new era for this iconic road. So, let us embark on this captivating journey together and discover the fascinating history of M-82, one of the great roads", "In 1963 and 1964, two realignments redirected the western end of the highway, now serving Hesperia and New Era while bypassing Ferry.

As a result of these acquisitions, Ragsdale and Ball became known as the founders of the city, and they began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections.", "As the residents of the city eagerly awaited the naming of their new settlement, intense debates erupted over the most fitting title. Ball and the industrious denizens of the region, deeply entwined with the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, rallied behind the name \"Meridian,\" cherishing its symbolic connection to \"junction.\" On the other hand, the agrarian populace of the city preferred \"Unknown\" (meaning \"mad river\" in a Native American language), echoing the spirit of the nearby creek. Ragsdale, too, staunchly advocated for \"Ragsdale City.\"  Ball, a visionary determined to showcase his railroad prowess, erected a grand station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, where the sign would alternate daily between \"Meridian\" and \"Unknown.\" As the years passed, the rapid development of the railroads attracted a wave of railroad workers, who eventually overpowered the other factions in the city. Their voices prevailed, and \"Meridian\" found a permanent place on the station sign.

The \"Golden Age\" of Meridian flourished from 1880 to 1910, when the burgeoning railroads facilitated rapid growth and attracted a flood of industries. This economic boom sparked a remarkable population surge, which subsequently ignited the commercial dynamism of the downtown area. By 1890, Meridian had risen to become the preeminent city in Mississippi and a pivotal hub for manufacturing in the Southern United States.

As residents migrated to the suburbs, leaving behind the urban core, the once bustling downtown areas became shadows of their former selves. Like the song of the nightingale, the soul of the city was fading. But then came the dawn of change. Strip commercial interests, like the whispers of hope, moved downtown, bringing with them a glimmer of revival. And so, the city, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, took notice. In the 1970s and 80s, the city worked to preserve the architectural character of Meridian. It designated several areas as historic districts, like a guardian protecting the city's history.

During the Great Depression, residents of the city were thinking about giving up on the airport because it was costing them a lot of money to maintain it. But in 1935, Fred and Al Key, who were the managers of the airport, had a brilliant idea to keep it running. For 27 days, from June 4th to July 1st, they flew over the city in their trusty plane, the \"Ole Miss.\" Can you believe it? These brothers were flying for a total of 653 hours and 34 minutes! That's a whole lot of time in the sky! Their incredible endurance caught the attention of the media and helped bring in enough funds to keep the airport open. That's right! The Key brothers' record for flight endurance is still unbroken today, proving that they truly knew how to make an impact in the skies. And that's why Key Field was named after these two amazing brothers. Talk about a great way to keep an airport running during tough times!", "In the early days of Meridian's public education system, it was grounded on the foundations laid by the 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, the City Council entrusted the Board of School Directors with the responsibility of overseeing the schools, which were responsible for the operation of the educational institutions. While there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and limited in number, enrolling only a few hundred students. It was not until September 1884 that the city inaugurated its first publicly owned school. The first public school for African Americans in the city was established in rented facilities from St. Paul Methodist Church, a testament to the community's determination to provide education to all. The Mississippi Legislature took further steps to improve the city's educational infrastructure in January 1888, when they amended the city charter to enable the establishment of a municipal school district. In March of the same year, the city was granted permission to issue $30,000 worth of bonds, an unprecedented opportunity to build new public schools. As a result, the Wechsler School was constructed in 1894, marking the first brick-built public school in Mississippi designed specifically for the education of African Americans. This remarkable achievement demonstrated the city's commitment to providing quality education to all its citizens, regardless of race or socio-economic background.", "As Meridian Public School District grew from its humble beginnings in this early district, it expanded to include 6 elementary schools, 3 middle schools, and 3 high schools.

With unwavering dedication, they collected and cherished each volume, nurturing the seeds that would bear the fruit of Meridian's treasured collection. The sunlit and moonlit realms were divided by a divide, but the spirit of learning united them in a shared quest for knowledge. As the years passed, the Fortnightly Club's dream took root and flourished, enlisting the aid of Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach Andrew Carnegie for funding.

The sight of the sturdy structure is a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of its builders. Upon entering these historic mills, one is met with a fixed lower millstone, serving as a foundation for the rotating upper millstone.

Tragedy struck the following day, however, when a passing trawler reported the wreckage of the Ben Doran.  In a desperate attempt to rescue the crew, the coastguard and local volunteers launched multiple rescue efforts. Regrettably, at that time, Shetland had no lifeboat available. Despite their valiant efforts, deteriorating weather conditions rendered the rescue attempts futile. A desperate plea was sent to the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, a mere 120 miles away, but alas, it was too late. Tragically, all nine crew members perished in the wreck. Of the three bodies recovered, one belonged to James Mitchell, who was returned to Aberdeen for burial. The remaining two bodies, those of J. Cormack and J.R. <unk>, were laid to rest in Scalloway. This sobering tale serves as a reminder of the relentless power of the sea and the unyielding determination of those who risk everything to protect their fellow mariners.", "\"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a captivating story to tell you about two ships that found themselves in treacherous circumstances. In February 1940, the cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground on an unknown island. But on this fateful day, the weather was on their side, and the ship and its cargo were the only ones lost. Fast forward to 1967, the Aberdeen trawler Juniper found itself stranded in Lyra Sound, at the bottom of 60-meter cliffs. But this time, fate had something else in store. The brave crew of 12 were saved by the quick thinking of the crew on a nearby lifeboat, and their coxswain was awarded the prestigious RNLI silver medal for his actions. So, what can we learn from these two ships? That even in the darkest of times, with the right team and a bit of luck, anything is possible.\"", "The most recent shipwreck on Papa Stour occurred on December 9th, 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler, the Elinor Viking, with skipper Alec Flett, foundered on Ve Skerries. Despite the efforts of the local lifeboat, the sea conditions were too treacherous for them to approach the scene. Consequently, at the request of Coastguard Officer Alec Webster from Lerwick, a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled. They managed to winch all the crew members to safety within hours, despite the storm force winds.  In recognition of their bravery, the helicopter crew received several awards. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the construction of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979. It is possible that this event served as the impetus for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit based at Sumburgh Airport.", "Crofting is a significant part of island life. Sheep are the primary agricultural livestock, but other species, such as cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, and geese, are also kept. Vegetable gardens can be found throughout the island, often tucked behind circular walls, a feature known as \"scrubs.\" Fishing is a smaller-scale activity on the island. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian-supported housing service that provides accommodation for men struggling with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now cross the Sound of Papa to West Burra on the Shetland Mainland, taking just 45 minutes to complete the journey. While the ferries carry cars, there is only one short road on the island, which offers protection for visiting yachts and provides good shelter from the strong tides in the area.", "\"Papa\" is the pioneering figure in the renowned \"Da Sang o da Papa men\" poem, now entrenched in the cherished folksong tradition, skillfully rendered into music by the illustrious <unk> Manson. The rhythmic, chorus chant, \"Foula Doon!\" is a powerful testament to its enduring legacy.", "\"Foula! <unk>!\" refers to the mesmerizing practice of navigating their open fishing boat out to sea until the majestic cliffs of Foula could no longer be seen. This entailed the boat sailing a staggering 96 kilometers (60 miles) west of Papa Stour. The tide and wind-driven 'tide-lumps' create unusually large swells, adding an element of thrill to the journey. The evocative final image of the piece showcases the fishermen being guided home to Papa by the'scent of Foula' across the glistening water. This exemplifies <unk>'s remarkable skill in painting a vibrant, sensory depiction of an event. An additional layer of meaning is imparted through the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time this poem was penned, making it not only a tribute to a lost way of life but also a tribute to a renowned geographical landmark.", "The opening track on Slayer's 1986 album Reign in Blood, \"Angel of Death,\" is a haunting and chilling ode to the infamous Nazi physician, Josef Mengele, who conducted gruesome human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.

As the years went by, that chilling truth would manifest itself in the haunting lyrics of \"Angel of Death.\" The song, a powerful testament to the unspeakable atrocities committed during World War II, would serve as a chilling reminder to the listeners of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.

As the haunting melody reached its crescendo, one couldn't help but feel a chill run down their spine", "In the somber halls of Auschwitz, a chilling dirge whispered tales of the infamous Angel of Death. A symphony of screams and cries for mercy intertwined with the sharp whispers of scalpels, as Mengele's cruel hands sought to unravel the very fabric of human nature. His experiments, as vile as they were, stretched beyond the bounds of sanity, reaching to probe the depths of despair, testing the very limits of human endurance. Among the macabre litany of horrors that echoed in the chamber, were the brutal surgeries conducted without mercy, the harrowing transfusions between desperate twins, the torturous isolation, the suffocating gas chambers, the lethal injections, and the gruesome transformations that sought to redefine the very essence of humanity. The mournful notes of the song of death whispered that each note, each agonizing note, was but a testament to the darkest depths of humanity's inhumanity.", "In the penultimate verse of the poem, a line reads, \"Together, joining heads. Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart,\" which serves as a nod to the infamous allegations against Josef Mengele, the notorious \"Angel of Death.\" The allegation, first made by Auschwitz survivor Vera Alexander in 1961 during the trial of SS officer Adolf Eichmann, the \"architect of the Holocaust,\" asserts that Mengele forcibly joined twin siblings, one of whom was a deformed individual. According to Alexander's testimony, the hunchback child was stitched together back-to-back with the other twin, their wrists connected as well. The claim gained widespread attention following Vera Alexander's appearance in the 1985 documentary, \"The Search for Mengele,\" which has been cited by several authors, including Gerald Posner, an expert on the Mengele subject. This allegation is a chilling reminder of Mengele's heinous experiments and brutal actions during the Holocaust.", "Amidst the storm of controversy and forbidden cries, \"Angel of Death\" took flight, enchanting the very essence of Slayer's 1986 album, Reign in Blood. The lyrical content, shrouded in darkness and defiance, stirred the hearts of the unyielding and challenged the foundations of convention. Def Jam Records, a sanctuary for the unorthodox, embraced the band with open arms. Yet, it was not to be; their distributor, Columbia Records, deemed the album's themes and artwork a sacrilege. The artwork, too graphic for the faint of heart, cast a chilling shadow over the world it sought to conquer. Unyielding, the band fought on, their hearts set ablaze by the inferno of defiance. Reign in Blood, a testament to their unwavering spirit, would not be silenced. And so, it was that Geffen Records, the phoenix rising from the ashes, took on the unenviable task of carrying the flames of rebellion into the world.

Forced to stand apart from the official release schedule, the album, like a warrior in the night, fought its own battle.
