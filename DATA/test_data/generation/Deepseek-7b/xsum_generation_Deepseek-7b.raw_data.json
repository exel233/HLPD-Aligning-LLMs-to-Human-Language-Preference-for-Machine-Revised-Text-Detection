The campaign also has the backing of the area's MP, Chancellor George Osborne. Cheshire West and Chester Council said a feasibility study would start soon. The Winnington Turn Bridge, which is part of the A533 between Northwich and the M56, is a Grade II listed structure and was one of the earliest swing bridges in Britain to have electric power. Vehicles can cross from both directions, but Dilys Hooper, the chairman of Barnton Parish Council, says waiting times of 40 minutes are common during rush hour in term time. \"It's just sheer mayhem, completely. It's a case of who can get across the bridge first,\" she said. Land across Northwich has been earmarked for at least 4,300 new homes.

Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m).

The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together.

Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody in April and died a week later. His death sparked weeks of protests and later riots and looting in Baltimore. \"As is often the case, during an ongoing investigation, charges can and should be revised based upon the evidence,\" Ms Mosby said. The grand jury did not return charges on the false imprisonment charges that were brought against some of the officers. Ms Mosby brought the false imprisonment charges earlier claiming that Gray's arrest was unjustified and illegal. However, the grand jury did return new reckless endangerment charges that were not part of the original charges announced three weeks ago. Ms Mosby has said that Gray's neck was broken while he was being handcuffed and placed into a police van.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones", "Four people were on board the Irish Coastguard Rescue Helicopter 116 when it went down on 14 March.

She said the figures were virtually the same, but just calculated differently. George Osborne was sharing a panel with Ms Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble when she made the remarks. \"Generally in any election year, the teams that provide the hypotheticals on which future deficits are forecast, err on the side of caution and assume that whatever is announced is not necessarily or inevitably going to happen,\" she said. Ms Lagarde added that the UK authorities had managed to provide the right balance of spending cuts and revenue raising. \"It's clearly also delivering results, because when we look at the comparative growth rates delivered by various countries in Europe,", "Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: \"If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love.\" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details.

The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these \"superfans\" help to \"drive the music festivals market\", often recommending music and events to their friends. They account for 28% of the festival-going audience, and more than half of them (54%) say they would be willing to attend an event alone. On average, they spend \u00c2\u00a345 more per event than a casual fan, but their loyalty is not guaranteed: 46% say that festivals are becoming \"too corporate\".

Its skipper said at the time his crew were lucky to escape unharmed, and the damage would cost about \u00c2\u00a310,000 to fix. The MoD has now said a British submarine was involved in the incident. It had previously said it did not comment on submarine activity.

In a written statement to the House of Commons, Minister for the Armed Forces Penny Mordaunt said: \"The incident, the delay in identifying and addressing the events on that day, and their consequences are deeply regretted. \"This incident occurred because the submarine did not correctly identify the Karen as a fishing vessel with nets in the water, and thus", "Kian Delos Santos was shot by police who said he was involved in the drugs trade and had resisted arrest.

The drive has been supported by many who are fed up with drug-related crime in the Philippines. Nuns, priests and hundreds of children chanting \"justice for Kian, justice for all\" joined the cortege from a church to the cemetery where the boy was buried, Reuters news agency reports. His father, Saldy, had spoken briefly during the Mass to insist on his son's innocence and vent his anger at the police. \"Don't they have a heart?\" he asked, his voice cracking with emotion. \"I'm not sure they do.

Information about Harvard's actions was reported by the Crimson - the main student newspaper at the prestigious college. The obscene material was posted to a chat forum on Facebook that grew out of a messaging group set up by students due to start studying at Harvard this year.

Other findings included that: Welsh speakers who gave evidence to the inquiry reported feeling awkward and struggling to explain their feelings to an English speaking doctor.

Although President Trump has referred to climate change as a \"hoax,\" this has not deterred those seeking to make a difference and protect the environment.\n\nIn a recent wave of protests and demonstrations, numerous individuals have been seen donning t-shirts emblazoned with the logos of these influential organizations, demonstrating a clear and powerful message. The utilization of these names is a strategic and assertive approach to address the issue of climate change, which many see as a pressing concern in the face of rising global temperatures and extreme weather events.\n\nThe protesters' use of these logos serves as a potent symbol of their commitment to preserving the planet for future generations. By directly taking on President Trump's stance on climate change, these activists are making it clear that there is a widespread demand for action on this critical issue.\n\nHowever, while the use of these logos is an effective way to garner public support, critics argue that it also risks giving credence to President Trump's own stance on climate change. Some argue that using these powerful names only strengthens the notion that those opposing the president are somehow aligned with his own views.\n\nNonetheless, the power of this symbolic protest cannot be ignored.

With just weeks to go before the historic vote, key figures from the Labour party have urged their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to unequivocally commit to the Remain campaign, in order to help secure a positive outcome for Britain.\n\nAmid rising concern over the potential damage to the UK economy and the loss of jobs that could come from a vote to leave, Labour figures have made the case that staying in the EU is the best course of action for the country. With Labour traditionally supportive of workers' rights and environmental protections, many party members argue that EU membership is crucial in protecting these interests, not to mention the benefits of being part of a wider trading bloc.\n\nThis decision by Labour to back the Remain campaign comes despite Jeremy Corbyn's often critical stance on the EU. While he has previously expressed concerns over the democratic deficit in the EU and the potential for more power to be concentrated in Brussels, he has also conceded that leaving the EU could have damaging consequences for the UK.\n\nMany within the Labour party argue that the party should not stand on the sidelines during this crucial period and that their leaders should actively support the Remain campaign. The reasoning is that an exit from the EU could lead to the weakening of the", "Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton, both of whom tragically lost their lives in a house fire. The prosecution alleges that Eteson, a self-employed electrician, failed to take the necessary safety precautions and standards when he worked on the property, leading to the fatal blaze.\n\nThe incident took place at a house in Blackpool, Lancashire, where Eteson had been contracted to install a new fuse board and rewire the property. The jury at the trial will hear evidence from witnesses and experts who will testify about the lack of proper safety measures taken by Eteson, including the absence of a residual current device (RCD), a device designed to protect against electric shock, and the failure to properly insulate exposed wires.\n\nThe prosecution is expected to argue that Eteson's negligence in carrying out his duties as an electrician led to the tragic deaths of Kelly Webster and Lauren Thornton, and that his actions constituted gross negligence manslaughter. The defense, on the other hand, will likely argue that the fire was an unfortunate accident and that Eteson did not have the requisite intent to cause harm.\n\nAs the trial continues, the court will hear from the families of the victims, who are seeking justice for their loved ones and closure after the harrowing incident. The outcome of the trial could have far-reaching implications for Etes", "Operator EDF Energy has announced that during planned maintenance on Reactor Three, three graphite bricks were discovered to have cracks.

The territory now covers a much smaller area compared to its peak in 2014, when it stretched across Iraq and Syria, reaching up to 110,000 sq km. The shrinking of the caliphate is a result of a combined effort by international and local forces to combat IS, as well as the group's failure to maintain control over its territories.\n\nAccording to analysts, the shrinking of the caliphate is a significant development in the fight against IS. This has led to the displacement of around 10 million people and has created a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. While IS has lost significant territory in recent years, the group's influence remains, with it still conducting attacks and attempting to recruit new members.

This marks a significant shift in the ongoing conflict, which has been characterized by intense fighting and civilian casualties.\n\nThe agreement, which was brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, aims to bring an end to the violence and create a more stable political environment.

This debate has sparked a larger conversation about transgender rights and the importance of providing a safe and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their gender identity.\n\nThe school district's stance on the matter is that the student's presence in the boys' restroom could potentially cause harm to other students, particularly those who are uncomfortable with the idea of a transgender individual using the facilities designated for the opposite sex. Opponents of this argument argue that the student's use of the appropriate restroom is a matter of privacy and safety, and that it is essential for the student's well-being to be able to use the facilities that align with their gender identity.\n\nSupporters of the transgender student argue that the student has undergone hormonal treatments and has been consistently identifying as a male for some time, and therefore, it would be detrimental to their mental health if they were forced to use the girls' restroom. Furthermore, they argue that the student's presence in the boys' restroom is not only necessary for their own well-being, but also for the benefit of other students, as it promotes inclusivity and acceptance of diversity.\n\nThis case is likely to continue to be a controversial topic as both sides make their cases, and ultimately it will be up to the", "Title: Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's Leader Advocates for Cheaper Fares to the Algar Route\n\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar's leader, Angus Campbell, has called for airlines to offer cheaper prices for travelers heading to the Algar route.

If successful, the new entity would be the largest mobile phone service provider in the country, with a combined market share of over 40%. The merger would also create a company with a strong position in terms of infrastructure and customer base, giving it the potential to compete effectively with international players like Orange and Vodafone.\n\nHowever, some critics have raised concerns about the potential consequences of such a merger.

This is the latest in a string of cyber-attacks targeting organizations across the world. The ransomware, known as \"WannaCry,\" has infected computers in over 150 countries, shutting down critical infrastructure and disrupting everyday life for millions of people.\n\nThe hackers have demanded that the victims pay the ransom in the form of Bitcoin, a digital currency that is difficult to trace. Many organizations have been hesitant to pay the ransom, as it can provide a financial incentive for hackers to continue their illegal activities. However, some have been forced to comply in order to regain access to their data and systems.\n\nThe WannaCry ransomware has been particularly devastating because it exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows systems. This vulnerability was already known to many security experts, but many organizations failed to patch their systems in a timely manner.
