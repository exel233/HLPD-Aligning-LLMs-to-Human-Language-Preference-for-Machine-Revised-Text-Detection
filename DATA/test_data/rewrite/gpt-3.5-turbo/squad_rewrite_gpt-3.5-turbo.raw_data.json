        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodríguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",
        "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981.

More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government",
        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade",

However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930.

        "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on",
        "John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases.

        "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the \"haircutting order\") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",
        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other",

In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les députés protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German",
        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at",

        "Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. \"plow\") accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of",

The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",
        "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that",
        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed – discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless.

        "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corvée\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage",

Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five",
        "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.",

In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week.

Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite",

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other.

It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine",

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.

        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie.

They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered England (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily.

        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space\". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating \"It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians",
        "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fernández Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists",
        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both:",

        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency",

        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple",

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti,",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely converting Iranian people from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia.

        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two",
        "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in",

        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed.

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish",

The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region.

The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.

        "The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.

        "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board",

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins",

The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections.

        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after",

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'() – early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from",
        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",
        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria",

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video.

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily",
        "It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).

        "Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.

The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

        "In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.",

As İnalcık mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" – key word being \"divine\".

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom",

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best",

        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in",

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an",

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to",
        "Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted",

In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd",

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to",

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa.

General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated.

        "Similar to reptiles, birds are predominantly uricotelic, meaning that their kidneys eliminate nitrogenous waste by converting it into uric acid and releasing it through the ureters into the intestine, rather than as urea or ammonia. Most birds lack a urinary bladder and external urethral opening, except for the ostrich, and therefore, uric acid is expelled along with feces in a semi-solid form. Nonetheless, certain birds like hummingbirds may exhibit facultative ammonotelism, where they eliminate a large portion of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia. Birds also excrete creatine instead of creatinine found in mammals. These waste products, together with intestinal waste, exit the bird's body through the cloaca, a versatile opening used for waste elimination, reproduction, and egg laying in females. Moreover, numerous bird species regurgitate pellets. Among the Palaeognathae males (excluding kiwis) and Anseriformes,",
        "Mammalian hair, also referred to as pelage, exhibits a range of colors that can differ among populations, individuals within a population, and even within the same individual. Variability in light and dark hues is prevalent across mammalian groups. While age can sometimes dictate color variation, other factors also play a role. Selective pressures, such as interactions with other populations and environmental circumstances, often drive color diversity in mammals. These pressures promote specific colors to enhance survival chances. Camouflage is believed to be a significant force shaping mammalian coloration, although sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes are also suggested to impact color evolution. Camouflage stands out as the primary mechanism driving color diversity.",
        "Education holds immense importance in the national culture of Israel, deeply rooted in its historical significance dating back to Ancient Israel. It was considered a cornerstone of ancient Israelite life, and this perspective has continued to shape Israeli culture's perception of higher education as a vital tool for social and economic advancement. The value placed on education in Israeli society can be traced back to the Jewish diaspora during the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement, leading up to the foundations of Zionism in the 1880s. Early Jewish communities in the Levant were pioneers in introducing compulsory education, underscoring the community's collective responsibility, alongside parents, for nurturing the education of future generations. The contemporary Jewish culture in Israel places a strong emphasis on fostering scholarship, intellectual pursuits, and academic achievement, reflecting the society's profound appreciation for higher education. The nation's remarkable university attainment rate further underscores the significant regard Israeli society holds for advanced education. Consequently, the Israeli education system has garnered widespread acclaim for its emphasis on academic excellence.",

        "After the fall of Wu and the upheaval caused by the Wu Hu rebellion against the Jin dynasty (265–420), many prominent Chinese families aligned themselves with the non-Chinese rulers in the north. Some faced a loss of social status and sought sanctuary south of the Yangtze River. Refugees from northern China likely settled in areas around Hangzhou. For instance, the descendants of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a notable chancellor of the state of Shu Han in north China during the Three Kingdoms era, established Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun) on the outskirts of Hangzhou. This village, inhabited exclusively by individuals bearing the surname \"Zhuge,\" intentionally remained secluded from neighboring communities for centuries until recently when its existence became public knowledge. This suggests that a select group of influential Chinese refugees from the Central Plain may have sought asylum there.",

The arrival of Henry Rodríguez, fondly called \"H-Rod,\" to bat cleanup provided lineup support for Sammy Sosa, with Rodriguez hitting 31 homers in his debut season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani excelled with a personal best of 19 victories, Rod Beck solidified the bullpen, and Mark Grace had a standout year. The Cubs attracted significant media attention in 1998, with Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood as the main attractions. Wood's standout moment was pitching a one-hitter against the Houston Astros, tying the MLB record of 20 strikeouts in a single game. His impressive strikeout performance earned him the nickname \"Kid K\" and the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year accolade. Sosa's shining moment came in June, setting a new MLB record with 20 home runs in a single month.",
        "In modern society, adolescents encounter various risks during the transition of their sexuality. While some, like emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs) such as HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, others like teenage pregnancy (resulting from non-use or failure of contraceptives) are viewed as societal concerns in many western cultures. Statistics show that one out of four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. In the United States, teenagers often opt for activities other than intercourse under the misconception that it decreases the chances of STIs. Healthcare providers nationwide are noticing an increase in cases of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to genital warts, with an estimated impact on 15 percent of individuals.",
        "Throughout the South Slavs' history, the vernacular, literary, and written languages, such as Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian, evolved and diverged independently based on different regions and ethnic groups. Before the 19th century, they were collectively known as \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\", or \"Croatian\". The term Serbo-Croatian was first introduced by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following years, and officially acknowledged by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. During that period, Serb and Croat territories were under the rule of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. The language was officially referred to as Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats commonly identified the language as \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\" respectively, without implying a distinction between the two. Additionally, in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were recognized as three names for a single language.",
        "Identity development is a crucial phase during adolescence when individuals typically embark on a quest to establish their sense of self. This exploration often involves experimenting with various behaviors and appearances to determine their true identity. Essentially, adolescents tend to experiment with different identities before settling on the one that resonates most with them. However, the journey of shaping and upholding one's identity during adolescence is complex, influenced by factors like family dynamics, surroundings, and social standing. Research indicates that this process is better characterized as identity development rather than formation, highlighting a natural evolution in both the substance and framework of one's identity.",
        "Similar to Egypt, the vast Seleucid Empire was primarily influenced by a Greco-Macedonian ruling class. The Greek populace in the urban centers, constituting the dominant class, was augmented by immigrants from Greece. Notable cities like Antioch, the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia, and Dura-Europos were among those established, maintaining Greek city-state structures such as assemblies and councils. Nevertheless, these institutions merely masked the control exercised by Seleucid officials. In addition to these urban centers, the Seleucids strategically positioned garrisons, military settlements, and Greek villages across the empire to solidify their authority.

One notable implication pertains to identity and its role in occupational environments, particularly in challenging or stigmatized jobs, also known as \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) emphasize that individuals are drawn to or deterred from specific jobs based on how well these roles align with their desired self-image within the organization. Different jobs carry varying degrees of stigma or prestige. For instance, Tracy discusses correctional officers' efforts to combat the perception of being mere \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). This process involves individuals rationalizing and assigning value to their career choices, influencing aspects such as job satisfaction and overall well-being (Tracy & Scott 2006).",
        "Emotions play a crucial role in driving social interactions and relationships, closely intertwined with fundamental physiology, especially the stress mechanisms. The connection between emotions and the anti-stress system, including the oxytocin-attachment system, is significant as it greatly influences bonding. The temperaments of emotional phenotypes impact social bonding and adaptability within intricate social structures (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These traits are not unique to humans but are also present in various species and biological classifications, attributed to genetic influences and their perpetuation over generations. Genetic codes in DNA sequences contain instructions for producing proteins that form our cells, with zygotes inheriting genetic material from parental germ cells. Throughout evolution, heritable characteristics that have promoted the survival of ancestral species are preserved and passed on.",
        "Stanley Schachter built upon the research of Spanish physician Gregorio Marañón, who administered epinephrine to patients and gauged their subsequent emotional responses. Marañón observed that although the patients felt something, they struggled to pinpoint the source of their emotions without a clear external trigger. Schachter concurred with the significance of physiological responses in emotions, proposing that these reactions assist in directing cognitive assessments of arousing situations. He posited that emotions resulted from a twofold process: initial physiological arousal and subsequent emotional experience. To illustrate, encountering a bear in the kitchen triggers a physiological response like a racing heart, setting the stage for the ensuing emotional reaction.",
        "The political unrest persisted, prompting John to consider forming an alliance with the recently returned French king Philip II, who had just come back from the crusade. John's aim was to secure Normandy, Anjou, and Richard's other French territories by joining forces with Philip. However, his mother advised him against pursuing this partnership. Longchamp, who had previously left England due to Walter's interference, made a comeback and contended that his removal as justiciar was unjust. John intervened, rejecting Longchamp's claims in exchange for support from the royal administration, which included a reiteration of his status as the throne's heir. With Richard still absent following the crusade, John started insinuating that his brother might be deceased or permanently lost. Unbeknownst to John, Richard had actually been captured on his way back to England by the Duke of Austria and was later handed over to Emperor Henry VI for ransom. John seized this opportunity and took action.",
        "In the beginning, Early Modern universities maintained the educational and research practices of the Middle Ages which encompassed natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (including astrology), law, grammar, and rhetoric. The teachings heavily featured Aristotle, with medicine also drawing from Galen and Arabic knowledge. The role of humanism in revolutionizing this traditional setup was paramount. Following the inclusion of humanist educators in university staff, there was a shift towards refining the study of grammar and rhetoric under the studia humanitatis. These professors emphasized students' proficiency in writing, speaking eloquently, translating and interpreting classical works, and leading ethical lives. The influence of humanist methodologies and linguistic abilities on other scholars within the university, concerning ancient texts, as well as the ideology emphasizing the significance of those texts, was profound. Even medical professors like Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop often adopted and imparted teachings from a humanist standpoint.",
        "Democratic Party candidates consistently won local elections, strengthening the city's connection to the South and its prevailing political faction. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood urged the aldermen to proclaim independence from Albany and the United States following the South's secession, though no action was taken. Outrage over the Civil War-era military draft laws, which exempted wealthier individuals who could afford a $300 commutation fee to hire substitutes, sparked the 1863 Draft Riots. Primarily involving working-class Irish immigrants, the riots escalated into violence against New York's upper class and later against black residents, stemming from intense competition between Irish newcomers and African Americans for employment opportunities. The rioters set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum, yet over 200 children were saved from harm thanks to the swift actions of the rescuers.",
        "However, in the mid-18th century, during the era of the French Enlightenment, a more conceptual interpretation of the term began to emerge. In 1765, an unidentified writer in a French Enlightenment magazine mentioned \"The widespread love for humanity... a quality previously unnamed among us, which we shall refer to as 'humanism,' as the time has arrived to coin a term for such a splendid and crucial concept.\" The latter part of the 18th century and the early 19th century witnessed the establishment of numerous community-based \"charitable\" and compassionate organizations committed to human advancement and the dissemination of knowledge (some with Christian ties, others without). Following the French Revolution, the notion that human goodness could be fostered through human intellect alone, separate from conventional religious establishments, a belief ascribed by critics of the Revolution to Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau, was fiercely debated.",
        "The outcome consisted of a series of inventive yet unpopular financial actions. John imposed scutage dues a total of eleven times during his seventeen-year rule, a stark contrast to the cumulative occurrences under the prior three rulers. Many times, these impositions happened without an ongoing military conflict, deviating from the original purpose of scutage as a substitute for actual military duty. John exploited his authority to collect relief payments upon inheritance of estates and castles, occasionally demanding exorbitant amounts that exceeded the financial capacity of the barons. Following the profitable sale of sheriff positions in 1194, John introduced a fresh round of appointments, enabling the new appointees to recoup their investment through escalated fines and penalties, especially within the forest regions. He also expanded Richard's initiative of heightened fees imposed on widows who chose to remain unmarried. Additionally, John persisted in the practice of selling charters for establishing new towns, including.",
        "During the Enlightenment, new concepts regarding religion emerged, such as Deism and discussions on atheism. Deism, as explained by Thomas Paine, is the belief in a single God as the Creator, without relying on the Bible or miracles, but rather on personal reasoning. This perspective found favor among many intellectuals of that era. While atheism was a topic of debate, it had limited proponents. Wilson and Reill suggest that most enlightened thinkers critical of Christianity were not true atheists but rather inclined towards skepticism, deism, vitalism, or pantheism. Some, inspired by Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could uphold moral principles. Others, like Voltaire, contended that without belief in a punishing God, society's moral fabric would weaken due to atheists not recognizing a supreme authority or moral code.",
        "Sleep does not impact the acquisition or recall of information while one is awake, with its primary influence being on memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain's neural connections are reinforced, enhancing its capacity to stabilize and preserve memories. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sleep plays a crucial role in enhancing memory retention through active consolidation. The process of system consolidation occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), during which memories are reactivated and transferred to long-term storage, although not all memories are equally enhanced. This process also involves qualitative modifications to memories as they are moved to long-term memory during sleep. As one sleeps, the hippocampus replays the day's events for the neocortex, which then reviews and processes memories for long-term storage. Insufficient sleep weakens neural connections, making learning more challenging and resulting in reduced memory retention.",
        "Memory does not function like a passive recording device, as commonly believed. The molecular processes involved in creating and retaining memories are intricate and involve distinct phases that can span from seconds to a lifetime. Studies have shown that memories are not exact replicas of events but rather are constructed. This construction occurs during the encoding and retrieval stages of memory. For instance, a study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) demonstrated how the phrasing of questions can influence memory recall. Participants who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher speed estimates compared to those asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when questioned a week later about seeing broken glass in the film, participants who had heard the word \"smashed\" were more likely to falsely recall seeing broken glass.",
        "Zhejiang in ancient times was not under the strong influence of the Shang civilization in the second millennium BC. Instead, it was inhabited by various groups collectively referred to as the Hundred Yue, which included the Dongyue and the Ouyue. Historical accounts from the Spring and Autumn Period mention the emergence of the kingdom of Yue in northern Zhejiang. According to ancient records, the rulers of Yue were believed to be descendants of Yu the Great, the founder of the Shang dynasty. The Baiyue people and the kingdom of Yue are believed to have had unique cultural and historical backgrounds distinct from the kingdoms in northern and central China, which had detailed records of their cultures and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Qin dynasty. One of the notable references to this is the \"Song of the Yue Boatman\" (Chinese: 越人歌, p Yuèrén Gē, lit. \"Song\").",
        "Protestantism extended from German territories to France, where adherents were known as Huguenots. Calvin, operating from Geneva, maintained interest in French religious matters and trained pastors for local congregations. Despite severe persecution, the Reformed movement gained ground in various parts of France, attracting those disillusioned by the rigidity and inaction of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism evolved into a politically charged movement, especially evident with the conversion of nobles in the 1550s, setting the stage for the French Wars of Religion. These conflicts escalated following the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559, characterized by atrocities and violence, culminating in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in August 1572, where the Roman Catholic faction massacred tens of thousands of Huguenots in France.",
        "In comparison to other team sports, the structure of the National Football League preseason is highly organized. Each NFL team participates in four pre-season exhibition games annually, comprising two home games and two away games. Additionally, two teams are selected each year to play a fifth game known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. The exhibition matches, predominantly taking place in August, serve the purpose of aiding coaches in trimming the roster from the offseason cap of 90 players to the regular-season cap of 53 players. Although the scheduling of preseason games is less strict than that of regular-season games, there exist several limitations and customs that govern the selection of opponents for these matches. Moreover, teams are bound by constraints regarding the days and times at which these games can be played. A notable practice observed in baseball and hockey, split-squad games, involves a team dividing its players into two squads when scheduled to play two games on the same day.",

In an effort to boost the economy, construction commenced on the ambitious Great Man-Made River project in 1983, a venture spearheaded by Muammar Gaddafi. Despite initial plans for completion by the end of the decade, the project remained unfinished as the new century began. Meanwhile, military expenditures surged while cuts were made to other government budgets. Libya's involvement in Chad's civil war included supporting the FROLINAT militia, leading to a re-invasion of Chad in December 1980 at the behest of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government. Gaddafi proposed a political merger in January 1981, which was rejected by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), prompting a Libyan withdrawal in November 1981. The conflict in Chad reignited, prompting Libya to dispatch troops again, resulting in clashes with French forces supporting the southern Chadian factions.",

To ensure security along the 24-kilometre relay route starting at Olympic Park from the 1988 Summer Games, over 8,000 riot police were deployed. The day of the torch relay saw confrontations between Chinese students and protesters, resulting in violence with the throwing of objects and physical altercations. A North Korean defector, whose brother was executed after attempting to flee to China, tried to self-immolate in protest against China's treatment of North Korean refugees. Despite attempting to set himself on fire by dousing in gasoline, the police intervened promptly, preventing the act. Additionally, two demonstrators made unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the torch relay. Near the start of the relay, clashes emerged involving 500 Chinese supporters and a group of individuals.",
        "The discussions surrounding the interpretations of separation by Jefferson and James Madison have persisted. During his presidency, Jefferson declined to issue Congress's Thanksgiving Proclamations but had issued a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Virginia's Governor. While Madison, as President, issued four religious proclamations, he vetoed two bills for breaching the first amendment. Despite this, both Jefferson and Madison were present at religious services held in the Capitol. Even before the Constitution's ratification, Madison argued that religion should not be under the control of society or the legislative branch. Following his presidential term, Madison advocated for the \"total separation of the church from the state,\" emphasizing the Constitution's strong protection of the division between Religion and Government.",
        "Virgil's works had a significant impact on Latin poetry immediately upon their release. The Eclogues, Georgics, and especially the Aeneid quickly became essential texts in the education of all well-read Romans. Poets who came after Virgil often allude to his works to add depth to their own poetry. For instance, the Augustan poet Ovid humorously mimics the beginning of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his condensed retelling of the Aeneas saga in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, dubbed the \"mini-Aeneid,\" stands out as a notable post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan’s Bellum Civile, an epic known for its departure from Virgilian conventions by eschewing divine intervention, focusing on historical events, and straying significantly from Virgil’s epic style. The poet Statius, of the Flavian era, extensively interacts with Virgil's poetry in his 12-book epic Thebaid; in the conclusion, he cautions his work not to \"compete with the divine Aeneid, but to respectfully trace its path from a distance.\" Silius Italicus, like Virgil, also...",
        "According to Terry Eastland, the author of the book \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" most arguments supporting affirmative action aim at rectifying past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland contends that the original architects of affirmative action did not foresee that its benefits would often be reaped by middle-class minorities who may not actually require it. She further posits that affirmative action can lead to a sense of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities due to the associated stigma. Eastland views affirmative action as a risky endeavor with inconsistent outcomes, suggesting that its absence could foster a more competitive environment. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his work \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\" identifies adverse effects of affirmative action, noting that these policies may prompt individuals from non-preferred groups to falsely identify as members of preferred groups, thereby potentially distorting the intentions of affirmative action.",
        "The most significant military engagement that involved the United States during this period was the War of 1812. Amid Britain's conflict with Napoleon's France, it aimed to obstruct American trade with France. While the United States aimed to stay impartial and continue international trade, Britain disrupted trade and pressed American sailors into the Royal Navy, sparking strong objections. Furthermore, Britain backed a Native American uprising in the American Midwest to establish a Native American state that would impede American westward expansion. This led to the United States declaring war on the United Kingdom in 1812, marking its first official declaration of war. Acknowledging the challenge of facing the powerful Royal Navy, the U.S. strategy involved invading British Canada in the hopes of using captured land as leverage. The Canadian invasion proved disastrous, although simultaneous conflicts with Native Americans in the west, such as Tecumseh's War and the Creek War, saw more success. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain deployed seasoned armies to invade.",
        "In relation to these peripheral areas, the Qing dynasty retained imperial authority, with the emperor assuming the roles of Mongol khan, supporter of Tibetan Buddhism, and guardian of Muslims. Nonetheless, Qing strategy shifted following the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. Amid The Great Game period, seizing the opportunity presented by the Dungan rebellion in northwestern China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with backing from the British Empire, proclaiming himself ruler of the Kashgaria kingdom. The Qing administration dispatched troops to quell Yaqub Beg, resulting in the reconquest of Xinjiang and the formal imposition of China's political framework on the region. The Kumul Khanate, integrated into the Qing empire as a vassal following its assistance in defeating the Zunghars in 1757, retained its autonomy post Xinjiang's provincial transformation until the demise of the dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution in 1930. In the early 20th century, Britain launched a military expedition to Tibet, compelling the Tibetans to conform to their demands.",
        "BYU boasts 21 NCAA varsity teams, with 19 of them primarily competing in the Mountain West Conference from 1999 until the school's departure in 2011. Before that, the teams participated in the Western Athletic Conference. All the teams are known as the \"Cougars,\" and the school's mascot, Cosmo the Cougar, has represented them since 1953. The Cougar Fight Song serves as the school's anthem. Due to many players undertaking two-year full-time missions (men at 18, women at 19), BYU athletes tend to be older on average compared to peers from other institutions. The NCAA allows students to go on missions for two years without affecting their eligibility. Although this practice has sparked some controversy, it's generally accepted that it doesn't give the school a significant advantage since players don't receive athletic training during their missions. BYU has also made headlines for its stance on refusing to compete in games on certain dates.",

In response, he endeavored to retaliate against Innocent personally and sow discord among English clergy supporting the Pope and those backing the English authorities. John confiscated the lands of clergy who refused to perform services, including properties associated with Innocent. He apprehended the mistresses of clergy, releasing them upon payment of fines, seized the estates of church members who fled the country, and assured protection for clergy loyal to him. Some institutions could negotiate terms to manage their properties and retain profits.

Their objective was to cross the Miluo River to reach Changsha. However, in January 1942, Chinese troops achieved a significant victory at Changsha, marking the first success for the Allies against Japan. Following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese military launched a large-scale operation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces in China, which became known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign. The primary goals were to locate the surviving American airmen, punish the Chinese who assisted them, and eliminate air bases. This offensive commenced on May 15, 1942, with 40 infantry battalions and 15–16 artillery battalions. Nonetheless, Chinese forces successfully fended off the Japanese advance by September. Throughout this campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army inflicted widespread destruction and chaos in the region.",

However, CNET criticized the perceived \"cheap\" quality of the design and disc-loader mechanism, likening it to old credit card imprinters and expressing a preference for autoloading disc trays. The review also pointed out that despite the smaller size and larger hard drive of the Super Slim model, it was seen as a drawback as the hard drive in the Slim model could be easily swapped out. Additionally, the review noted that the pricing of the Super Slim model was higher than the Slim model, suggesting that the enhanced features may not justify the increased cost.",

This directive was succinctly summarized as: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" For the Manchus, the edict served as a loyalty test and a means of identifying allies and enemies. Conversely, for the Han Chinese population, it represented a degrading imposition of Qing authority that clashed with their ingrained Confucian beliefs. According to the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing), which emphasized the sanctity of one's body and hair as parental gifts, altering one's hair was deemed unacceptable. During the Ming dynasty, adult men maintained their hair long instead of adhering to the mandated hairstyle.",
        "Boundaries can be either inclusive or exclusive, depending on how they are perceived by others. For instance, an exclusive boundary is established when an individual sets a restriction through a marker that limits the actions of others. Conversely, an inclusive boundary is formed when a marker is used that others are willing and able to connect with. Yet, an inclusive boundary also restricts those included by confining their inclusion in other boundaries. For instance, when a newcomer in a multilingual gathering uses a specific language, some attendees may comprehend it while others may not. Those who do not understand the language might interpret its use as a neutral expression of identity or as an exclusive boundary meant to differentiate them from the newcomer.",
        "During the era of 78 rpm records, manufacturers experimented with novel materials to create flexible or \"unbreakable\" records. In the UK, Nicole records, composed of celluloid or a similar substance layered onto a cardboard core disc, were introduced in 1904 but were plagued by excessive surface noise issues. In the United States, Columbia Records launched the flexible fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" in 1907, which promised a quieter surface with the use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles, but it failed to gain popularity. Thin, bendable plastic records like the German Phonycord and British Filmophone and Goodson records emerged around 1930 but had short lifespans. The French Pathé Cellodiscs, crafted from a thin black plastic, bore a striking resemblance to the traditional shellac records of the time.",
        "In 1919, after the Treaty of Versailles, the city was returned to France without a plebiscite, following U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points.\" The official transfer took place on Armistice Day. The outcome of a potential referendum in Strasbourg favoring France remains uncertain, as political factions advocating for an independent Alsace or alignment with France held minimal influence in both the last Reichstag and local elections. Pro-French Alsatian autonomists garnered significant support in rural areas and other municipalities following the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement commenced during the initial Reichstag election, with the elected representatives known as \"les députés protestataires.\" These delegates remained the sole Alsatian representatives in the German parliament until Bismarck's downfall in 1890.",
        "While Western Europe saw the emergence of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained undivided and underwent an economic resurgence until the early 7th century. The Eastern part faced fewer invasions, primarily in the Balkans, and maintained peace with Persia for most of the 5th century. A distinct feature of the Eastern Empire was the close relationship between the government and the Christian Church, where doctrinal issues played a significant role in politics, unlike in Western Europe. Legal advancements included the codification of Roman law, starting with the completion of the Theodosian Code in 438. Emperor Justinian (527–565) initiated another compilation, the Corpus Juris Civilis, and oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. During his reign, North Africa was reclaimed from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths by Belisarius (d. 565), although the conquest of Italy remained incomplete due to a severe plague outbreak in 542, leading Justinian to focus on defensive strategies for the remainder of his rule.",
        "Upon the release of the NES in the US, Nintendo intentionally opted for a distinct design approach compared to other gaming consoles. The aim was to set their product apart from competitors and break away from the negative perception that game consoles had garnered post the 1983 video game crash. As part of this strategy, Nintendo concealed the cartridge slot as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, cleverly resembling a VCR's front-loading mechanism. While this innovative connector functioned effectively with clean components, prolonged use led to the bending of contact pins and the ROM board within the cartridge due to the force applied when inserting the cartridge. With continuous cartridge insertions and removals, the pins suffered wear and tear over time, challenging the ZIF connector's longevity.",
        "Protestants were pioneers in advocating for religious freedom, with a strong emphasis on freedom of conscience following Luther's stand at the Diet of Worms in 1521. Luther believed faith was a personal choice guided by the Holy Spirit and could not be imposed. Anabaptists and Huguenots who faced persecution also pushed for freedom of conscience and upheld the separation of church and state. Baptists such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys defended religious freedom in the early 17th century, influencing later thinkers like John Milton and John Locke. Leaders like Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn established democratic colonies in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, respectively, with provisions for religious freedom. These colonies welcomed persecuted religious groups, including Jews, and laid the groundwork for the principles enshrined in the United States Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights.",
        "Birds possess a highly effective oxygen diffusion system in their blood, with a gas exchange surface area ten times larger compared to mammals. This results in a higher concentration of blood in their capillaries per lung volume unit than in mammals. The arteries are built with robust elastic muscles to endure ventricular pressure and gradually stiffen away from the heart. Blood flows through the arteries, experiencing vasoconstriction, and then enters arterioles that function as a distribution network for oxygen and nutrients to all body tissues. Arterioles branch out further from the heart into organs and tissues, dividing to enhance surface area and regulate blood flow. Within the capillaries, located in organized beds within tissues, gas exchange takes place.",
        "The men's basketball team boasts a remarkable record of over 1,600 wins, a feat achieved by only 12 schools, along with 28 appearances in NCAA tournaments. Notably, former player Austin Carr set a tournament record by scoring 61 points in a single game. While the team has never clinched an NCAA Tournament victory, they were honored twice as national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation. Renowned for their upsets of top-ranked teams, their most famous triumph was halting UCLA's historic 88-game winning streak in 1974. They have defeated eight more number-one teams, trailing only UCLA's ten victories in this category. Competing at the revamped Purcell Pavilion in the Edmund P. Joyce Center since the 2009–2010 season, the team is under the guidance of coach Mike Brey, who has led them since the 2014–15 season.",
        "A century following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon documented in his publication Observations in 1553 that a substance called pissasphalto, a blend of pitch and bitumen, was utilized in Dubrovnik for coating ships and later traded in the Venetian market. The usage of asphalt in France was reported in an 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine. A pamphlet dated 1621 by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys\" mentioned the discovery of abundant asphaltum near Neufchatel and proposed various applications, notably in constructing airtight silos and safeguarding Paris waterways from contamination with arches.",
        "Established in 1852, Marshall Field & Company was the leading department store situated on State Street in Chicago, the primary shopping hub in the Midwest. Drawing in affluent customers from all over the region who arrived by train and stayed at nearby hotels, it expanded into a prominent chain before rebranding as Macy's on 9 September 2006. Marshall Field's was renowned for its exceptional customer service, setting a benchmark for other department stores. It introduced the iconic Frango mints, closely associated with both Marshall Field's and Chicago, acquired from the now-defunct Frederick & Nelson Department Store. Pioneering several innovations, Marshall Field's housed the first European buying office in Manchester, England, and initiated the concept of the bridal registry. It was also the first to offer personal shoppers, a complimentary service available in all Field's stores until the chain's closure.",
        "Certain street trams utilized conduit third-rail technology for power collection, with the third rail positioned below street level. The tram accessed the current using a plough (known as a plow in the U.S.) through a narrow slot in the road surface. In the United States, a significant portion of Washington, D.C.'s former streetcar system, discontinued in 1962, operated in this fashion to eliminate the visual clutter of overhead wires and poles typical of electric traction systems. A similar approach was taken with Manhattan's erstwhile streetcar network. Remnants of this operational method are still observable on the track leading down the incline at the northern entrance to the disused Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, where the slot between the running rails remains visible. Additionally, traces of this system can be found on P and Q Streets to the west of Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C.'s Georgetown district.",
        "According to the 2010 Census, the Asian American population in New York City exceeds one million, surpassing the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York City boasts the highest number of Asian residents among all U.S. cities. Queens, a borough of New York City, is home to the largest Asian American community in the state, as well as the largest Andean populations in the country, making it one of the most ethnically diverse urban areas globally. The Chinese community is the fastest-growing nationality in New York State, with satellite Chinatowns flourishing in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens, and expanding into suburban Nassau County on Long Island. The New York metropolitan region and the state have become primary destinations for new Chinese immigrants, leading to ongoing large-scale immigration into New York City and its vicinity. As of 2012, Chinese residents made up 6.3% of New York City's population.",
        "In their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles offer a detailed critique of using FST in analyzing human populations. They argue that the commonly cited 85% figure for genetic diversity across human populations is misleading as it suggests equal genetic representation across all groups. Long and Kittles contend that this approach oversimplifies human population history by assuming independence among groups. They propose a more accurate perspective that acknowledges some groups as ancestral to others, creating paraphyletic relationships. For instance, according to the recent African origin theory, the African population is considered paraphyletic to non-African groups, serving as the ancestral source for the latter. However, non-African populations trace back to a limited and non-representative subset of the African population.",
        "There was a surge in privatization in Libya's economy, with government officials rejecting the socialist principles of nationalized industries from The Green Book. They claimed to be establishing \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Muammar Gaddafi supported these changes and called for extensive privatization in a speech in March 2003. By 2003, the oil sector had been mostly handed over to private companies, leading to a substantial increase in foreign direct investment to $40 billion by 2004, a sixfold jump from the previous year. Some segments of the Libyan population protested against these reforms, resulting in public demonstrations. In March 2006, radical revolutionaries seized control of the GPC cabinet, moderating the pace of reforms but not stopping them altogether. Plans were revealed in 2010 to privatize half of Libya's economy in the next ten years, although there was no corresponding political liberalization, and Gaddafi remained in power. Nonetheless, in March 2010, the government granted more authority to municipal councils.",
        "Military operations commenced in September 1806, marked by the initiation of maneuvers. In a significant correspondence with Marshal Soult outlining the campaign strategy, Napoleon delineated the key principles of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the concept of the \"square battalion\" known as le bataillon-carré. This innovative strategy involved the synchronized marching of various Grande Armée corps in close proximity to provide mutual support. By utilizing the bataillon-carré system, if one corps came under attack, the others could swiftly come to its aid. Leading an invasion of Prussia with an army of 180,000 soldiers, Napoleon swiftly advanced along the right bank of the River Saale. His primary objective, consistent with past campaigns, was to eliminate one adversary before reinforcements from another could alter the war's outcome. Upon locating the Prussian forces, the French forces changed course to the west and crossed the Saale with superior strength. The decisive battles of Jena and Auerstedt took place on 14 October, resulting in a resounding victory for the French forces.",
        "Many historians believe that the removal of Maxim Litvinov, who was not favored by Nazi Germany due to his Jewish background, paved the way for German-Soviet negotiations. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to remove Jews from the ministry. Litvinov, known for his efforts to build an anti-fascist coalition, his alignment with collective security alongside France and Britain, and his relatively pro-Western stance within the Kremlin, indicated the Soviet Union's readiness to engage with Germany. Molotov's appointment signaled the USSR's openness to German propositions. Litvinov's departure also suggested to France and Britain the possibility of negotiating with Germany. A British official noted Litvinov's departure as the loss of a skilled diplomat, contrasting Molotov's approach as more in line with Bolshevik principles than traditional diplomacy. Carr highlighted the Soviet Union's shift in foreign policy with the replacement of Litvinov.",
        "Critics characterized Gaddafi as despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain, and unintelligent, while western governments and media portrayed him as the oppressive dictator of a suffering nation. During the Reagan era, the United States viewed him as their top adversary, famously labeling him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". Critics highlighted that under Gaddafi's rule, Libyans lived in constant fear due to widespread government surveillance. Gaddafi's regime was commonly referred to by western observers as a repressive regime. Critics condemned the human rights violations in Libya, with organizations like Human Rights Watch (HRW) reporting that many arrested political dissidents were denied fair trials, subjected to torture, or faced extrajudicial killings, notably in instances like the alleged massacre in Abu Salim prison on June 29, 1996.",
        "A true predator is typically defined as an organism that hunts and consumes another living organism. While other types of predators harm their prey in various ways, this specific type causes the death of its prey. Predators may actively seek out their prey through pursuit predation or wait for the prey to come within striking distance, as seen in ambush predators. Some predators, like jaguars or humans, kill large prey, dismembering or chewing it before consumption, while others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, ingest their usually smaller prey whole. Animals such as domestic cats and dogs exhibit flexibility in their hunting methods, consuming large insects whole but dismembering a rabbit, depending on the circumstances. Certain predators use venom to incapacitate their prey before consuming it, ensuring the prey is killed before ingestion.",
        "Twice in ancient history, the Israelites experienced periods of political independence, initially during the era of the Biblical judges and later in the United Monarchy.[disputed – discuss] Following the decline of the United Monarchy, the land was split into Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" originated from the Roman term \"Judean,\" referring to individuals from the southern kingdom of Judah. This shift in the ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews,\" specifically meaning inhabitants of Judah, though not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, can be found in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a text within the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, the King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem, demolished the First Temple, and exiled the prominent citizens of Judah. By 586 BC, Judah no longer existed as an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jewish population was left without a state. The Babylonian captivity concluded in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire overtook Babylon, and Cyrus the Great",
        "Van Praag points out that the Ming court's diplomatic relations with Tibet were primarily to acquire much-needed horses. According to Wang and Nyima, these interactions did not constitute formal diplomacy as Tibetan regions were under Ming rule, with Tibetan leaders holding positions as Ming officials. They further argue that horses were obtained from Tibet as part of a compulsory \"corvée\" tax, suggesting that Tibetans were dealing with internal matters rather than engaging in foreign diplomacy. Sperling adds that the Ming procured horses from the Kham region, battled Tibetan tribes in Amdo, and received Tibetan delegations in Nanjing. He suggests that the visits of Tibetan lamas to the Ming court were largely aimed at facilitating commercial exchanges between the lamas' affluent entourage and Ming Chinese traders and authorities. Kolmaš notes that although the Ming adopted a hands-off approach towards Tibet and restricted the size of Tibetan delegations, Tibetans aimed to uphold a tributary bond with the Ming due to imperial favor.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor passed away on November 14, 1908, followed by the death of Cixi on November 15, 1908. Speculations emerged suggesting Cixi or Yuan Shikai might have instructed loyal eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor, a theory validated by a post-mortem examination almost a hundred years later, which revealed toxic levels of arsenic in his remains. Puyi, the son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and the nephew of the childless Guangxu Emperor, was anointed as his heir at the age of two, with Zaifeng assuming the role of regent. Subsequently, General Yuan Shikai was relieved of his influential positions. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet featuring two vice-premiers. However, this cabinet was commonly referred to as \"The Royal Cabinet\" by contemporaries due to the fact that, within the thirteen-member cabinet, five were closely associated with the royal family.",
        "Feathers are shed regularly through a process known as moulting in birds. The standard plumage observed in birds post-moult, following the breeding period, is referred to as the \"non-breeding\" or \"basic\" plumage according to the Humphrey-Parkes classification system. Breeding plumages, or variations of the basic plumage, are categorized as \"alternate\" plumages in the Humphrey-Parkes system. While most species undergo an annual moult, some may experience two moults per year, and larger birds of prey might moult only once every few years. Moulting sequences differ among species. In perching birds, or passerines, flight feathers are typically replaced one by one, starting with the innermost primary feather. As the fifth or sixth primary feather is renewed, the outermost tertiaries begin to shed. Following the moult of the innermost tertiaries, the process moves to the secondaries from the innermost outwards (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts shed in coordination with the primaries they cover. A few species, like",
        "Agrarian societies emerged in southeast Europe during the 7th millennium BC, evidenced by the discovery of one of Europe's earliest farming sites in Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. Anthropomorphic figurines dating from 6000 BC have been unearthed in the Balkans and around 5800 BC in Central Europe (La Hoguette). The Sesklo culture in Thessaly is among the earliest cultural complexes in the region, later expanding into the Balkans and giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča cultures. Neolithic traditions spread westward and northward through a mix of cultural diffusion and migration, reaching northwestern Europe around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture is credited with potentially developing the earliest system of writing known as the Vinča signs, although archaeologist Shan Winn suggests that they likely functioned as pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully evolved form of writing.",
        "Various reasons have been proposed for Yale's involvement in national elections post-Vietnam War. It is widely acknowledged that a culture of campus activism has thrived at Yale since the 1960s, influenced by Reverend William Sloane Coffin and the institution's emphasis on grooming future leaders, a tradition initiated by Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard Levin, former Yale President, links this trend to Yale's commitment to nurturing leadership potential. Richard H. Brodhead, ex-dean of Yale College and current Duke University president, highlights the university's emphasis on community engagement in its admissions process and a strong volunteerism tradition. Yale historian Gaddis Smith highlights a culture of organized activities at Yale in the 20th century, citing examples such as John Kerry, George Pataki, and Joseph Lieberman who were involved in various leadership roles during their time at Yale. Camille Paglia also underscores this historical trend.",
        "Among major Canadian cities, St. John's stands out as the foggiest (124 days), windiest (with an average speed of 24.3 km/h (15.1 mph)), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). Despite being milder during winter compared to other Canadian cities, St. John's boasts the mildest winter of any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. The city experiences frequent and heavy precipitation year-round, with the driest season typically being summer, characterized by sporadic thunderstorm activity. Conversely, the wettest period spans from October to January, with December being the wettest month, averaging almost 165 millimetres of precipitation. This peak in winter precipitation is atypical for humid continental climates, which typically see increased precipitation in late spring or early summer.",

However, due to pressure from Chinese authorities amid protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists disrupting the event, the route was shortened. A town hall ceremony was canceled at the request of Chinese officials, and the torch's final leg was completed by bus rather than by athletes. Paris City officials had intended to peacefully protest upon the torch's arrival in the French capital, displaying a banner advocating for human rights.",
        "In Europe and the United States, green is widely associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy, according to surveys conducted. Despite some negative connotations such as death, sickness, or the devil in these regions, green holds overwhelmingly positive symbolism in China, where it represents fertility and happiness. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, clothing color denoted social status, with green attire being worn by merchants, bankers, and the gentry, contrasting with the association of red with nobility. Notably, in Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the presence of green attire signifies the absence of noble lineage. Similarly, green benches in the British House of Commons juxtapose with red benches in the House of Lords. Beyond symbolism, green is universally recognized as a color denoting safety and permission, as seen in traffic lights signaling \"go ahead\" and green cards granting permanent residency.",
        "The era marked Libya's re-emergence on the global stage. Starting in 1999, secret negotiations between Libya and the British government aimed at restoring diplomatic ties. By 2001, Gaddafi openly denounced the September 11 attacks, showing solidarity with the victims and advocating Libyan participation in the global War on Terror against extremist Islamism. Concurrently, his regime cracked down on domestic Islamist movements, even as he endorsed a broader implementation of sharia law. Libya also solidified relationships with China and North Korea, receiving a visit from Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Following the aftermath of the Iraq War, Libya publicly renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction in December 2003, dismantling its chemical and nuclear arms programs. This decision led to improved relations with the U.S., culminating in a meeting between UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. Shortly after, Gaddafi journeyed to the European Union (EU) headquarters in Brussels, marking a significant enhancement.",
        "In 356, Constantius decreed Liberius' exile, granting him a mere three-day deadline for compliance. The ousted Liberius was directed to Beroea in Thrace and offered substantial gifts, including five hundred pieces of gold, as inducement to embrace the Arian doctrine. However, Liberius rejected the gifts, suggesting they be given to his sycophants instead. He similarly spurned a gift from the empress, urging the messenger to embrace Christianity and desist from persecuting the Church. Despite efforts to leave the offerings in the Church, Liberius discarded them. Constantius then summoned Liberius to Milan under tight security. During a documented meeting, Liberius fearlessly informed Constantius that Athanasius had been vindicated at Sardica, branding his adversaries as liars and impostors, and decrying the injustice.",

        "The Montana Territory was established on April 26, 1864, following the enactment of the Organic Act by the U.S. Even before its official designation as a territory, the region saw the emergence of schools as families began to settle there. Initially, subscription schools were prevalent, often conducted in the teacher's residence. One of the earliest documented formal schools was established at Fort Owen in Bitterroot Valley in 1862, catering to Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen staff members. The school term commenced in early winter, concluding by February 28, under the guidance of Mr. Robinson. Another subscription school, founded by Thomas Dimsdale, operated in Virginia City in 1863, requiring students to pay $1.75 weekly. In 1864, the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly convened for the first time and endorsed county tax levies for schools, laying the groundwork for public education.",
        "Self-esteem, a crucial element in identity development, encompasses one's perceptions and emotions regarding their self-concept and sense of self. Various theories emphasize the universal inclination, irrespective of age or gender, to safeguard, boost, and preserve self-esteem. Despite common belief, there is no substantial proof of a notable decline in self-esteem during adolescence. Though \"barometric self-esteem\" may fluctuate rapidly, triggering distress and anxiety, underlying self-esteem generally remains constant throughout adolescence. Criticisms have been raised concerning the reliability of global self-esteem assessments, with suggestions that more targeted scales could offer deeper insights into the adolescent psyche. For girls, nurturing relationships with friends play a pivotal role in fostering high self-esteem, with the core purpose of friendship often revolving around the provision of social and moral support.",
        "The deeper ancestral demographics of Bermuda's population have been concealed due to the ethnic blending over the past four centuries. The distinction between black and white Bermudians is almost non-existent, except for recent immigrant groups. In contrast, during the 17th century, the population composition was quite different. Initially, white Protestants of English descent dominated the settlement for the first century, with smaller white communities of Irish and Scots who were sent to Bermuda post the English invasions of their countries following the English Civil War. Among the non-white minorities were Spanish-speaking free blacks from the West Indies, black slaves mainly seized from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from Algonquian and other tribes along the Atlantic coast, possibly even from as far as Mexico. As the 19th century approached, the numerical superiority of white Bermudians of English descent dwindled.",
        "Intel had made efforts to persuade Apple to switch the Macintosh platform to Intel chips, but Apple declined due to concerns about Intel's CISC architecture being unable to rival RISC processors. Although the Motorola 68040 could outperform the Intel 80486 in certain aspects, the 486 could achieve higher clock speeds without overheating issues, particularly the i486DX2 which operated at twice the external bus speed. This allowed IBM compatible systems with the 486 to outperform Macintosh models significantly. Apple's decision to limit the use of the '040 to expensive Quadras while the 486 was more widely accessible to OEMs and enthusiasts exacerbated the situation. By late 1991, as Apple's high-end Macintosh desktops shifted to the '040, the company faced challenges in keeping up with the advancements in the industry.",

        "In order to mitigate the risk of mixing out-of-phase supplies, it is essential to maintain strict isolation between sections of the line that are fed from distinct feeder stations. This separation is ensured through the use of Neutral Sections, also referred to as Phase Breaks, which are typically installed at feeder stations and at intervals between them. Usually, only half of these Neutral Sections are active at any given time, with the remaining ones serving as backups to facilitate the shutdown of a feeder station and the transfer of power from neighboring stations. Neutral Sections generally comprise an earthed wire segment that is insulated from the adjacent live wires by materials like ceramic beads. This design allows the pantograph to transition smoothly from one section to another. The earthed segment acts as a barrier to prevent the formation of an arc between live sections, particularly when there is a voltage disparity between them due to different phases. In such cases, the protective circuit breakers may struggle to safely interrupt the high current flow.",
        "Carolingian art was primarily created for a select group associated with the court, as well as the monasteries and churches they endorsed. It aimed to revive the grandeur and elegance of imperial Roman and Byzantine art while being influenced by Insular art from the British Isles. Insular art combined the vigor of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic ornamentation with Mediterranean forms like manuscripts, shaping artistic characteristics throughout the medieval era. Surviving religious artworks from the Early Middle Ages consist mainly of illuminated manuscripts and intricately carved ivories, initially crafted for metalwork that has since been lost. Artworks in precious metals held the highest prestige, yet only a handful remain intact, including notable pieces like the Cross of Lothair, various reliquaries, and discoveries like the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain, and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine.",
        "Successful cotton cultivation necessitates an extended period without frost, abundant sunlight, and a moderate rainfall ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). While soils typically need to be somewhat dense, the nutrient content does not have to be extraordinary. Generally, these requirements are found in the seasonally arid tropics and subtropics of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, a significant amount of today's cotton is grown in regions with lower precipitation levels, relying on irrigation for water supply. Each year, production typically commences shortly after the prior autumn's harvest. Although naturally a perennial, cotton is planted annually to manage pests effectively. Planting times in the Northern hemisphere vary from early February to early June in spring. The region in the United States known as the South Plains is particularly renowned for its cotton production.",
        "During Darwin's lifetime, the book underwent numerous translations, which encountered challenges in accurately conveying its concepts and metaphors, leading to potential biases reflecting the translators' personal agendas. Darwin himself provided copies of the book to individuals in France and Germany in the hope of finding competent translators, with the expectation that they would independently arrange for publication with local publishers. One notable translator, the esteemed naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, produced a German version in 1860 that incorporated his own interpretations, introducing contentious topics excluded by Darwin. For instance, Bronn substituted \"favoured races\" with \"perfected races\" and included additional essays on subjects such as the origins of life and a concluding chapter on religious connotations influenced by his commitment to Naturphilosophie. Following Darwin's feedback, Bronn issued a second edition in 1862 based on the third English edition, but tragically passed away from a heart attack. Subsequently, Darwin collaborated closely with Julius Victor Carus, resulting in an enhanced translation published in 1867.",

However, they encountered a formidable adversary in the form of the Dukes of Normandy. In 1066, William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087) led the conquest of England (r. 1066–87), establishing a trans-channel empire that endured in different iterations throughout the Middle Ages. The Normans also colonized Sicily and southern Italy, following Robert Guiscard's (d. 1085) arrival in 1059 and the subsequent creation of a duchy that evolved into the Kingdom of Sicily.

        "After his father Sviatoslav I's death in 972, Vladimir, who had been prince of Novgorod, fled to Scandinavia in 976 due to his half-brother Yaropolk's murder of their other brother Oleg and subsequent control of Rus. With the assistance of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir raised a Viking army and recaptured Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's significant accomplishment was the conversion of Kievan Rus' to Christianity, which commenced in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, Vladimir made the decision to abandon traditional idol worship (paganism) of the Slavs in favor of a new faith. He dispatched trusted advisors and warriors as emissaries to various European regions to explore Christianity.",
        "Galicia was relatively spared from the major conflicts of the war, being one of the regions where the initial coup succeeded, thus remaining under Nationalist control led by Franco's army throughout the duration of the war. Despite the absence of large-scale battles, the region experienced oppression and casualties: all political parties, labor unions, and Galician nationalist groups such as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos were dissolved. Galicia's autonomy statute was also revoked, similar to Catalonia and the Basque provinces once they were captured. According to Carlos Fernández Santander, a minimum of 4,200 individuals, including republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists, were either extrajudicially executed or after hasty trials. Among the victims were the civil governors of all four Galician provinces, Juana Capdevielle (the wife of A Coruña's governor), and mayors like Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela from the Partido Galeguista, as well as prominent socialists.",
        "The majority of fatty acids are considered non-essential as the body can synthesize them as required, typically utilizing energy from other fatty acids. Nonetheless, in humans, two essential fatty acids are crucial and must be obtained through the diet. Maintaining a proper balance of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids is believed to be vital for overall well-being, despite a lack of definitive experimental evidence. These long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, known as omega-3 and omega-6, are precursors for a group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins, which play various roles in the human body, acting as hormones in some capacities. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, can either be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid, or obtained from marine sources. EPA serves as a foundational element for series 3 prostaglandins, such as the mildly inflammatory PGE3. On the other hand, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, acts as a precursor for series 1 prostaglandins.",
        "The collegia appointed public priests who, upon election, gained enduring religious authority believed to be bestowed by the eternal divine. This authority granted them lifelong influence, privileges, and immunity. Consequently, both civil and religious laws placed restrictions on the number and types of religious positions that an individual and their family could hold. The religious laws, based on tradition and collegial practices, played a crucial role in shaping political decisions and had the power to override them, making it challenging for personal exploitation. Becoming a priest was considered an esteemed yet expensive honor, as priests in traditional Roman customs did not receive a salary. Offerings made to the deity belonged to the deity, requiring the priest to cover any deficits in public funding for the cult's needs, such as supporting assistants and maintaining the cult, from their personal finances. For individuals who had completed the Cursus honorum, a permanent priesthood was typically pursued or bestowed after a lifetime dedicated to military or political service, ideally both.",

She made their marriage public during a video presentation at the Sony Club in Manhattan on October 22, 2008, while celebrating the launch of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. The album hit the shelves on November 18, 2008, in the US, unveiling Beyoncé's alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which originated during the creation of her hit single \"Crazy in Love\" in 2003. With a successful debut week, selling 482,000 copies, it claimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart, marking Beyoncé's third consecutive number-one album in the nation. Notable tracks from the album include the chart-topping \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\" along with the hits \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo,\" which also reached the top five. \"Halo\" emerged as Beyoncé's lengthiest-running Hot 100 single, bolstering her chart presence and further solidifying her status as a top artist in the US.",
        "Darwin was deeply engrossed in his work on the comprehensive manuscript about Natural Selection when he was surprised with a package from Wallace on 18 June 1858. Wallace, who was situated in the Maluku Islands, enclosed twenty pages outlining an evolutionary concept in response to Darwin's earlier encouragement. He asked Darwin to pass it on to Lyell if he found it promising. The concept bore resemblance to Darwin's own theory, prompting Darwin to inform Lyell that his prediction had been exceeded, and he intended to offer to publish it in a journal of Wallace's choice. Darwin expressed concerns about the potential impact on his own original ideas. Lyell and Hooker proposed a collaborative publication combining Wallace's work with excerpts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and a 1857 letter to Gray to be presented at the Linnean Society. Consequently, on 1 July 1858, the joint papers were titled On the Tendency to conform to the Conditions of Existence.",

As per a 2012 report presented by GHMC to the World Bank, Hyderabad is home to 1,476 slums accommodating a total of 1.7 million inhabitants, with 66% residing in 985 slums situated in the central area of the city, which constituted Hyderabad prior to the expansion in April 2007. The remaining 34% of the population live in 491 suburban settlements. Approximately 22% of households in the slums had relocated from various parts of India during the last decade of the 20th century, and 63% reported residing in the slums for over a decade. The overall literacy rate in the slums ranges between 60–80%, with female literacy standing at 52–73%. Basic service connections are available in one-third of the slums, while the rest rely on general public services provided by the government.

        "Numerous modern specialty matches have been created, each with its own distinct set of victory conditions. One of the most popular among these is the ladder match, where participants must climb a ladder to claim a prize suspended above the ring. The strategy in this match involves incapacitating opponents to allow one wrestler to ascend the ladder and secure the prize for their team, often utilizing the ladder as a weapon. Prizes can vary and may include a championship belt, a document granting a future title shot, or any item of significance to the wrestlers involved. Another frequently seen specialty match is the battle royal, where 20-30 wrestlers compete simultaneously in the ring.",
        "Following Cassander's demise in 298 BCE, Demetrius, armed with a substantial loyal army and navy, invaded Macedon, claimed the Macedonian throne in 294, and subjugated Thessaly and the majority of central Greece between 293 and 291. In a turn of events in 288 BC, he faced defeat as Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus launched a dual invasion of Macedon, swiftly dividing the kingdom amongst themselves. Demetrius sought refuge in central Greece with his hired soldiers, rallying support in the region and the northern Peloponnese. Subsequently, he besieged Athens following their betrayal, yet eventually negotiated a pact with the Athenians and Ptolemy. This agreement permitted him to cross into Asia Minor to battle Lysimachus' territories in Ionia, while leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in charge in Greece. Despite early triumphs, he surrendered to Seleucus in 285 and passed away in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686) was a groundbreaking work as it was the first to present scientific theories in a way that appealed to the general public, particularly women interested in science. This book inspired similar works that aimed to make scientific concepts more accessible to a wider audience. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was one such work that was advertised as a fresh approach to the subject, offering simple rules and astronomical tables for readers. Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (1738) introduced Newtonianism and the Principia to a French audience, while Émilie du Châtelet's posthumous translation of the Principia in 1756 further contributed to the dissemination of Newton's ideas outside academic circles.",
        "In 633 AD, the Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran, leading to its conquest by 651 AD. This resulted in a significant conversion of the Iranian population from indigenous faiths such as Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. The official language shifted from Persian to Arabic, although Persian continued to be used by the general populace and in literature. Iran played a vital role in the Islamic Golden Age, fostering numerous influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. The establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501 marked another turning point, as it converted Iranians from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, making it the state religion. This transition had far-reaching implications in both Iranian and Muslim history. Under Nader Shah from 1736 onwards, Iran expanded its territories to reach its largest extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly holding one of the most powerful empires of its time. However, by the 19th century, Iran began losing parts of its territories in the Caucasus, which had been integral to its identity for centuries, to Imperial Russia due to popular unrest.",
        "A 2002 Guardian report highlighted findings from a government report, revealing that from 1940 to 1979, the Ministry of Defence utilized various regions across the country as a clandestine laboratory for conducting germ warfare experiments on civilians. These experiments reportedly included the release of potentially hazardous chemicals and micro-organisms over significant portions of the population without their knowledge. While the Ministry of Defence contends that the trials were intended to simulate germ warfare and were harmless, families residing in the vicinity of these experiments have reported an increase in birth defects, and physical and mental disabilities among their children. Consequently, there is a growing call for a public inquiry into these incidents. The report states that these experiments impacted an estimated millions of individuals, with one particular instance between 1961 and 1968, where over a million residents along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria such as e.coli and bacillus globigii, a substance that mimics anthrax.",
        "The first years of the 1980s witnessed significant changes in both lineup and musical direction for established hard rock bands. Tragic losses included Bon Scott, the vocalist of AC/DC, and John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Following Scott's death, AC/DC persevered and released the monumental album Back in Black (1980) featuring their new frontman, Brian Johnson. Meanwhile, Led Zeppelin disbanded shortly after Bonham's passing. Concurrently, Black Sabbath parted ways with original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and recruited Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow. This lineup change revitalized the band, leading to a fruitful creative phase commencing with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne initiated a successful solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), accompanied by the talented guitarist Randy Rhoads. Notably, some bands like Queen transitioned from hard rock to a more pop rock style, while others maintained their hard rock essence.",
        "By illustrating interactions among a limited set of particles within the confines of spacetime through his diagrams, Feynman was able to formulate a comprehensive representation of physics based on the spins of these particles and the extent of the fundamental forces' connections. Feynman delved into elucidating the strong forces that dictate the scattering of nucleons with his parton model, which emerged as a counterpart to the quark model devised by his Caltech peer Murray Gell-Mann. The link between these two models was somewhat unclear, with Gell-Mann somewhat mockingly labeling Feynman's partons as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, the prevailing belief among physicists was that quarks served merely as a theoretical tool for organizing symmetry numbers and were not tangible entities, given the challenging statistical implications of the Omega-minus particle if interpreted as a trio of identical strange quarks bound together. The deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted at the Stanford linear accelerator in the late 1960s served as an analogy to Ernest Rutherford's gold nucleus-alpha particle scattering experiment, ultimately shedding light on the nature of quarks.",
        "Without any warning or promotion beforehand, Beyoncé surprised everyone on December 13, 2013, by launching her self-titled fifth album on the iTunes Store. The album quickly rose to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, marking Beyoncé's fifth consecutive number-one album in the United States. This remarkable achievement solidified her as the first female artist to have her initial five studio albums debut at the number one spot. The album was highly praised and achieved commercial success, with over a million digital copies sold worldwide in just six days. Critics highlighted the unconventional and unexpected release strategy as a significant moment. The album, characterized by an electro-R&B sound, delved into darker themes previously unexplored in Beyoncé's repertoire, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression, and the fears and insecurities associated with marriage and motherhood.\" The track \"Drunk in Love,\" featuring Jay Z, reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following intense speculation, Beyoncé and Jay Z confirmed their joint On the Run Tour in April 2014, marking their first collaborative tour.",
        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were primarily based on traditional medicinal practices. The use of mixtures with antimicrobial properties in infection treatments dates back over 2000 years, with ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Greeks utilizing specific molds, plant materials, and extracts for this purpose. It was through later laboratory observations of antibiosis among microorganisms that natural antibacterials produced by these microorganisms were discovered. Louis Pasteur noted the potential of intervening in the antagonism between bacteria for therapeutic benefits, stating, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics.\" The term 'antibiosis', denoting \"against life,\" was coined by French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin to describe the action of these early antibacterial agents. The concept of antibiosis in bacteria was initially documented in 1877 by Louis Pasteur.",
        "In situations involving three or more parties, it is common for no single party to hold power independently. Instead, parties collaborate to establish coalition governments. This practice has become increasingly prevalent in the political landscape of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s, and it is a standard approach in Germany both at the national and state levels, as well as in many local constituencies. Similarly, since the establishment of the Republic of Iceland, coalition governments, typically led by the Independence Party in conjunction with another party, have consistently governed the country. The Republic of Ireland has also experienced a similar trend, with no party holding sole power since 1989, leading to the formation of several coalition governments, usually spearheaded by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Coalition governments are often viewed as facilitating political transitions more effectively compared to systems dominated by a single party or two major parties.",
        "The City of Melbourne responded to the attribution of recent climate change by setting a goal in 2002 to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2020. Similarly, Moreland City Council initiated the Zero Moreland program. However, not all metropolitan municipalities have embraced this initiative, as evidenced by the City of Glen Eira's decision in 2009 to not pursue carbon neutrality. Melbourne's expansive urban footprint, characterized by low-density housing, has led to extensive suburban sprawl, high reliance on cars, and limited public transport options beyond the inner city. Much of the city's vegetation consists of non-native plant species, primarily of European origin, which often harbor invasive species and harmful weeds. Common urban pests introduced to Melbourne include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling, and red fox. Certain outlying suburbs, particularly those bordering the Yarra Valley and hills to the northeast and east, have experienced prolonged periods without beneficial regenerative fires, resulting in a scarcity of young trees and undergrowth.",

        "The Royal Assent ceremony is held in the Senate since the monarch traditionally cannot enter the House of Commons. During the event, the Senate's Speaker reads a notice from the governor general's secretary to inform about the viceroy's or deputy's arrival time. The Senate must remain in session until the ceremony is completed. The Speaker then moves to the throne's side, accompanied by the Mace Bearer holding the mace, while the governor general takes the Speaker's chair. Following this, the Speaker instructs the Usher of the Black Rod to summon the Members of Parliament to the Senate chamber. The parliamentarians, escorted by the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the House of Commons' mace, follow Black Rod to the Senate. In the Senate, the Members of Parliament from the commons stand behind the bar while Black Rod stands beside the governor general, who signifies Royal Assent to the bills presented (excluding appropriations bills) by nodding.",
        "Scotland, on the other hand, had maintained its independence as a kingdom. However, in 1603, this changed when the Scottish King inherited the thrones of England and Ireland. This set off a turbulent period in the 17th century marked by political unrest, religious conflicts, and warfare. The expansion of English colonialism in Ireland during the 16th century was furthered by the establishment of significant Scottish and English settlements in Ulster. The religious divide deepened, leading to clashes between the English King and parliament, particularly concerning his lenient stance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War, also known as the War of the Three Kingdoms, culminated in the establishment of a republican government in England. Despite the loyalty of predominantly Catholic Ireland to the monarchy, the defeat of the royalist forces by the parliamentary army resulted in substantial land transfers from Irish nobility to English commoners aligned with the parliament. This shift laid the foundation for the emergence of a new ruling class, the Ascendancy, which gradually supplanted the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish populations over the following century.",
        "During the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom evolved into the Maratha Empire led by the Peshwas, or prime ministers. A significant victory in 1737 occurred when the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in the Battle of Delhi, held in the Mughal capital. They continued military campaigns against various powers such as the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and Durrani Empire to expand their territories. Gordon elaborated on the Maratha’s methodical approach to territorial expansion, which involved annual raids, collecting ransom, and ultimately taking control of regions while the weakened Mughal Empire retained symbolic authority. The process, exemplified by their actions in the Malwa region, demonstrated their effective public administration system known for meticulous attention to detail. This approach enabled them to boost revenue in districts that had suffered from years of raids, restoring them to previous prosperity levels.",
        "In 1939, the Bureau initiated the creation of a custody list comprising individuals earmarked for potential detention in case of a conflict with Axis powers. The list predominantly featured Issei community figures, drawing from an earlier Naval Intelligence roster focusing on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast. Additionally, numerous German and Italian nationals were added to this confidential register. Acting on authorization from Hoover, Robert Shivers, in charge of the Honolulu office, commenced detaining individuals on the list on December 7, 1941, amidst the Pearl Harbor bombings. Subsequent to the attack, widespread arrests and house searches (often conducted without warrants) unfolded, resulting in the apprehension of over 5,500 Issei men by the FBI in the following weeks. President Franklin Roosevelt later issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, permitting the relocation of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Notably, FBI Director Hoover expressed opposition towards this directive.",
        "The effectiveness of the body's response to antigens varies depending on factors such as age, the type of antigen, maternal influences, and the site of antigen exposure. Neonates are considered to have a form of natural immunodeficiency since their innate and adaptive immune reactions are significantly weakened. Following birth, a child's immune system shows a stronger reaction to protein antigens compared to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Notably, neonates are prone to infections caused by less virulent pathogens like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Neonates exhibit limited opsonic activity and capacity to trigger the complement cascade. For instance, the average C3 level in newborns is roughly 65% of that in adults. Furthermore, newborns have significantly reduced phagocytic activity due to lower opsonic function and decreased expression of integrin and selectin receptors, which hinders neutrophils from interacting effectively with endothelial adhesion molecules.",
        "Following independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. was established on 15 April 1948 by merging 28 small princely states, including feudal princes and zaildars, situated in the western Himalayan region known as the Simla Hills States, along with four Punjab southern hill states. This integration was formalized through the issuance of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 in 1950). The State of Bilaspur was incorporated into Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 through the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal Pradesh attained the status of a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the enforcement of the Indian Constitution.",

The relay encountered chaos when the initial runner vanished into a warehouse on a pier by the waterfront, remaining there for approximately thirty minutes. Amidst the confusion, clashes erupted between numerous pro-China demonstrators, allegedly transported by the Chinese Consulate and like-minded organizations, and supporters of Tibet and Darfur. Reports indicated that the non-Chinese protesters were overwhelmed and followed by hostile crowds.

        "A typical adult football game consists of two 45-minute halves that run continuously without stopping the clock when the ball is out of play. There is a standard 15-minute halftime break between the halves, and the conclusion of the game is referred to as full-time. The referee is responsible for keeping time and can add extra time, known as stoppage time or injury time, to compensate for delays due to substitutions, injuries, or other interruptions. The duration of stoppage time is determined solely by the referee, who also signals the end of the match. In games with a fourth official, the referee announces the amount of stoppage time to be added near the end of each half, with the fourth official displaying this information on a board for players and spectators to see.",
        "Identification of an infectious agent is typically recommended only when it can contribute to the treatment, prevention of the disease, or enhance understanding of the illness before effective therapeutic or preventive measures are available. For instance, in the early 1980s, when AZT was not yet available for AIDS treatment, monitoring patient blood samples was crucial for tracking the disease progression, despite the limited treatment options. These studies on HIV emergence in certain communities helped in formulating hypotheses about virus transmission routes. This knowledge allowed for targeted resource allocation to high-risk communities to reduce new infections. Serological, genotypic, or molecular identification of HIV also facilitated the development of hypotheses regarding its temporal and geographical origins.",
        "Since gaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a link between East and West and actively pursued economic restructuring and alignment with Western nations. Estonia's implementation of market reforms has elevated its economic status within the former COMECON region. In 1994, inspired by Milton Friedman's economic principles, Estonia was among the pioneers in adopting a flat tax system, setting a constant rate of 26% for all income levels. Subsequent adjustments saw a decrease to 24% in January 2005, further reduced to 23% in January 2006, and eventually reaching 21% by January 2008. Despite a delayed adoption of the euro in 2011 due to persistent high inflation, Estonia had finalized the design of its euro coins in late 2004. The country also imposes a Land Value Tax, collected at the state level but entirely allocated to support local municipalities. The tax rate is determined by the authorities.",
        "Saint Helena, spanning 122 km2 (47 sq mi), consists mainly of rugged volcanic terrain with the last eruptions dating back about 7 million years. Its coastal regions are characterized by volcanic rock, warmer temperatures, and aridity compared to the interior. The island's highest peak, Diana's Peak, rises to 818 m (2,684 ft) and was designated as the first national park in 1996. While much of the land is dominated by New Zealand flax due to past industries, efforts like the Millennium Forest project, initiated in 2002 to restore the lost Great Wood, have reintroduced original trees, overseen by the Saint Helena National Trust. Initially lush with unique native flora, including a distinctive cabbage tree species, the island's hinterland likely featured dense tropical forests, while the coastal areas may have exhibited similar characteristics.",
        "In the mid-1980s, well-established bands experienced a resurgence. Deep Purple reformed with their iconic Machine Head line-up after an 8-year hiatus, releasing Perfect Strangers (1984). The album achieved significant success, reaching number five in the UK, top five in five other countries, and earning platinum status in the US. Similarly, Van Halen recovered from slower sales of their fourth album with the release of Diver Down in 1982, followed by their commercial peak with 1984. The album peaked at number two on the Billboard chart and featured the chart-topping single \"Jump\".

        "The United States operates primarily as a two-party system, with one party being conservative (like the Republican Party) and the other liberal (like the Democratic Party), which has been the norm in American politics. Initially, the Federalist and Republican parties were established, followed by a period of Republican dominance. This was later divided into National Republicans and Democratic Republicans, leading to the formation of the Whig Party and the Democratic Party. The Whigs disintegrated after a short span due to disagreements over slavery, with anti-slavery factions joining the newly formed Republican Party. While third parties, such as the Libertarian Party, typically lack significant backing and rarely secure election victories, there have been instances where they have impacted the outcomes of elections by drawing votes away from the expected winners, as seen in the cases of Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election and George Wallace in the 1968 election.",
        "In July 2013, Notre Dame underwent significant changes in its conference affiliations for all sports except football and fencing due to a major conference realignment. The transition continued in July 2014 with adjustments to its fencing affiliation. The move from the Big East to the ACC was prompted by instability in the former, while maintaining football independence with a commitment to play five games annually against ACC teams. The reshuffling in collegiate ice hockey, following the Big Ten Conference's inclusion of the sport in 2013–14, led to Notre Dame relocating its team from the dissolved Central Collegiate Hockey Association to Hockey East. Additionally, Notre Dame's entry into the ACC resulted in the conference including fencing as a sponsored sport starting in the 2014–15 academic year. The origins of the Fighting Irish nickname, while having various theories, remain tied to the school's athletic identity.",

Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan opted out of carrying the torch, whereas Konnie Huq chose to participate while expressing criticism of China. Member of Parliament Norman Baker urged all participants to reconsider their involvement. Prime Minister Gordon Brown greeted the torch outside 10 Downing Street without physically handling it, amidst conflicting pressures. The relay in London was closely guarded, with the BBC noting a protective perimeter around the torch. Demonstrations started early on, resulting in about thirty-five arrests. An incident in Ladbroke Grove saw a protester trying to grab the torch from Konnie Huq, leading to a brief scuffle, while a separate event involved the activation of a fire extinguisher near the torch. The torch was later carried through Chinatown by the Chinese ambassador.",

The layout was influenced by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, where the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'(). Early typewriters did not include 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead. However, as 0 and 1 became common, the 1! and 0) pairs were introduced. In ASCII, !\"#$% were positioned in the second column, rows 1–5, mirroring the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, as the space character occupied the spot for 0. To address this, the _ (underscore) was removed.",
        "The transition to adolescence signifies a rapid shift in familial roles. While younger children assert themselves assertively, they typically lack significant sway over family decisions until early adolescence, when parents begin to regard them as equals. Adolescents must navigate the delicate balance of gaining autonomy while maintaining a nurturing relationship with their parents. Puberty often triggers heightened parent-child conflicts and weakened family cohesion. Disputes commonly revolve around issues like curfews, clothing choices, and privacy rights, previously seen as parental domain. With peers exerting more influence, adolescents may adopt values contrary to their parents', leading to increased disagreements. The rise of social media has further fueled conflicts between adolescents and parents, introducing new challenges not previously faced by parents.",
        "The primary method utilized for diagnosing infectious diseases is through microbiological culture. This technique involves providing a growth medium suitable for a particular infectious agent. A sample collected from potentially affected tissue or fluid is then examined for the presence of an infectious agent capable of thriving within that medium. Nutrient agar, a solid medium containing essential carbohydrates, proteins, and water, is commonly used to cultivate most pathogenic bacteria. Each bacterium multiplies to form a visible colony on the plate, which can either stand alone or merge with neighboring colonies to create a \"lawn\".

The former Head Master, Tony Little, expressed Eton's commitment to enabling any boy to enroll regardless of their parents' financial status. Little mentioned that in 2011, about 250 students were granted substantial financial aid. By early 2014, this number had increased to 263 students, with approximately 60% fee coverage, and an additional 63 students received a tuition-free education. Little aimed to expand the number of students receiving bursaries to 320 annually, including 70 students who would attend tuition-free, ensuring a continued increase in the accessibility of Eton College.",
        "Brian May and Roger Taylor had previously played in a band called Smile before establishing Queen. Freddie Mercury, initially known as Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara, was a Smile fan who inspired the band to explore more intricate stage and recording methods. Mercury officially joined in 1970, proposed the name \"Queen\" for the group, and adopted his iconic stage moniker. Prior to the production of their self-titled debut album in 1973, John Deacon was brought on board. Queen's breakthrough in the UK occurred with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that propelled them to global fame. The latter featured the epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", a chart-topper in the UK for nine weeks and a pioneer in music video promotion. In 1977, their album News of the World showcased hits like \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", now iconic anthems in the sports world.",
        "On 13th March, the port of Clydebank, located on the upper Clyde near Glasgow, was bombed, resulting in damage to almost all of its 12,000 houses. Several other ports were also targeted during this time. Plymouth experienced five attacks by the end of the month, whereas Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were also struck. Cardiff endured bombings on three consecutive nights, and Portsmouth was significantly affected by five separate raids. By September 1940, approximately 40,000 civilians were losing their homes weekly due to these attacks. In March 1941, 148,000 individuals were displaced following two raids on Plymouth and London. Despite sustaining severe damage, British ports managed to continue supporting the war effort, facilitating the passage of supplies from North America. The Royal Navy remained operational in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth, in particular, faced the most intense assaults due to its exposed location on the south coast and proximity to German air bases. For instance, during the 10th and 11th of March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries, causing extensive destruction to residential and commercial areas.",
        "The origin of collegiate a cappella is not definitively known. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, established in 1873, is believed to be one of the oldest collegiate a cappella groups. On the other hand, The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, founded in 1909 and once counting Cole Porter as a member, is likely the longest-running a cappella group. Throughout the 20th century, collegiate a cappella groups saw significant growth. Some notable early groups include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). Soon after, all-female a cappella groups emerged, often as a playful response to the men's groups, such as the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936) and The Shwiffs of Connecticut College.",
        "Interaction among peers in adolescent groups provides a platform for young individuals to delve into their emotions, self-identity, and enhance their social capabilities. These groups allow adolescents to cultivate essential social skills like empathy, cooperation, and leadership. Adolescents tend to gravitate towards peer groups with similar characteristics to their own, aiding in the acceptance of their evolving selves. By engaging in these interactions, adolescents incorporate the norms and values of their peer groups into their self-perception. Through honing communication abilities, observing peers, and reflecting on personal beliefs, adolescents can openly share their emotions and concerns without the fear of judgment. Peer groups can positively impact individuals by boosting academic motivation and performance; however, they can also pose negative influences by promoting risky behaviors such as substance abuse and vandalism through peer influence. The susceptibility to peer pressure typically peaks around the age of 14 and decreases in later adolescence.",
        "Following a period of internal strife within the Liberal Party, former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock engaged in a power struggle. This unrest occurred against the backdrop of the early 1990s recession in Australia, where the unemployment rate soared to 11.4% in 1992. Dr. John Hewson spearheaded the launch of the extensive 650-page Fightback! policy document in November 1991. This document proposed a series of far-reaching economic reforms, including the controversial introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), modifications to Medicare such as eliminating bulk billing for non-concession holders, imposing a nine-month cap on unemployment benefits, scrapping industrial awards, implementing a $13 billion tax cut for middle and high-income brackets, slashing government spending by $10 billion, abolishing state payroll taxes, and embarking on a significant privatization program for state-owned enterprises. These proposals signaled a departure from the Keynesian economic principles traditionally upheld by the Liberal/National Coalition.",
        "References to legal matters in To Kill a Mockingbird, especially in non-courtroom settings, have piqued the interest of legal experts. According to Claudia Durst Johnson, legal scholars have produced a more extensive body of critical analysis in law journals than literary scholars in literary journals. The quote from Charles Lamb, an essayist from the 19th century, asserting that \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once,\" is introduced at the beginning. Johnson highlights the instances where compromises and agreements are made through symbolic gestures like spitting on one's palm in Scout and Jem's childhood world, while laws are deliberated by Atticus and his children, such as questioning the ethics of Bob Ewell's off-season hunting and trapping activities. Symbolic courtrooms witness the violation of numerous social norms, as exemplified by Mr. Dolphus Raymond's ostracization for his relationship with a black woman and their mixed-race children.",
        "In the latter part of 1975, Queen recorded and released their album A Night at the Opera, drawing inspiration from the well-known Marx Brothers film of the same name. This album set a record as the most costly production at that time. Similar to their previous work, the album showcases a variety of musical genres and experiments with stereo effects. For instance, in the song \"The Prophet's Song,\" a section features a canon technique, layering basic phrases to produce a rich choral effect. Another track, \"Love of My Life,\" written by Mercury, includes a harp accompaniment and intricate vocal harmonies. A Night at the Opera achieved significant success in the UK and earned triple platinum status in the US. It was recognized as the 13th best album ever by the British public in a 2004 Channel 4 survey and has also received high rankings in global rankings. In a worldwide poll by Guinness, it was voted the 19th greatest album, and in an ABC poll, Australian listeners ranked it as the 28th best album of all time.",
        "Although the concept of Mary's Immaculate Conception was not initially prominent among Latin theologians, especially Frankish ones, it gained significance in the Byzantine East, influenced by Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology during the Medieval era. While individuals like Emperor Justinian I and hymnographers often referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their writings, Sophronius of Jerusalem was the first to delve deeper into Nazianzen's ideas. Sophronius suggested that Mary was already immaculate and was further \"purified\" during the Annunciation. He even proposed that Mary's holiness surpassed that of John the Baptist, who was considered the holiest man born of a woman, emphasizing Mary's exceptional sanctity. St. John Damascene (d. 749/750) expanded on Sophronius' teachings, praising Mary's purification at the Annunciation and attributing to her the unique ability to purify baptismal waters through her touch.",
        "During the torch relay route, various protests erupted. Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, led by pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, held up inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they claimed represented democracy. Their demands included justice for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the establishment of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also participated, expressing admiration for the courage of those speaking out in Hong Kong. Amidst the protests, pro-democracy activists faced verbal attacks from torch supporters, who hurled insults such as \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" Simultaneously, around 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front displayed orange banners advocating for human rights advancements and universal suffrage. Onlookers attempted to conceal these banners with a large Chinese national flag while questioning the protesters in Mandarin putonghua, asking, \"Aren't you Chinese?\"",
        "Zhejiang's key industries include electromechanical, textiles, chemicals, food, and construction materials. The region has adopted a distinctive development approach known as the \"Zhejiang model\", which centers on fostering entrepreneurship, supporting small businesses adaptable to market demands, significant public investments in infrastructure, and the mass production of affordable goods for both local and international markets. This strategy has propelled Zhejiang to become one of the wealthiest provinces in China, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" gaining renown. Nonetheless, concerns are growing among economists regarding the sustainability of this model due to its inefficiency, heavy reliance on resources and public services, and limitations in transitioning the numerous small enterprises towards more advanced industries.",

        "Although Ottoman madaris offered a variety of subjects including calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, their main purpose was to serve as Islamic institutions for spiritual education. According to İnalcık, the ultimate goal of knowledge, especially spiritual sciences, was to attain knowledge of God. Religion played a significant role in determining the value and relevance of each field of study. İnalcık also noted that subjects that supported religion were considered beneficial, while disciplines like astrology were deemed unfavorable. Despite including mathematics and logic in their curriculum, these subjects were always intertwined with religious teachings. İnalcık highlighted that Ottoman scholars believed that disregarding logic and mathematics was pointless as they helped in fostering correct thinking and revealing divine truths. The emphasis was always on the religious aspect, even in the study of philosophy.",
        "Galicia, known for being inhabited since the Middle Paleolithic era, derived its name from the Gallaeci, a Celtic group residing north of the Douro river around the last millennium BC. This area closely aligned with the Castro culture of the Iron Age. Transitioning into Roman rule post the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, Galicia became a Roman province by the 3rd century AD. The Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with Braga as its capital in 410, which later fused with the Visigoths' realm in 585. Following the Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 and the subsequent takeover of the Visigoth kingdom, Galicia became part of the Asturias Christian kingdom in 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia intermittently had its own monarchs, yet mostly remained united with the kingdom.",

The Scottish Highlands in the north of Great Britain are hilly, with Ben Nevis standing as the highest point at 1,343 m (4,406 ft). Wales and parts of Ireland also have mountainous regions, yet only seven peaks surpass 1,000 m (3,281 ft). While most lakes on the islands are small, Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is a significant outlier, spanning 150 square miles (390 km2). Loch Lomond is the largest freshwater body in Great Britain by area, covering 27.5 square miles (71 km2), and Loch Ness holds the most volume. Meanwhile, Loch Morar boasts the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, plunging to a maximum depth of 310 m (1,017 ft).",
        "Following the Second World War, Britain and its empire emerged triumphant, yet the aftermath of the conflict had profound effects globally and domestically. Much of Europe, once a dominant force, lay in ruins and was now occupied by the United States and the Soviet Union, marking a shift in global power dynamics. Britain found itself in dire financial straits, narrowly avoiding insolvency in 1946 by securing a $US 4.33 billion loan (equivalent to US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, with the final repayment made in 2006. Concurrently, independence movements were gaining momentum within the European colonies. The geopolitical landscape was further complicated by the escalating Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. While both nations officially opposed European colonialism, American anti-communist sentiments took precedence over anti-imperialism, leading to the US backing the British Empire's continuity to counter Communist expansion.",
        "Homer mentions the \"Hellenes\" (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a small tribe residing in Thessalic Phthia, with their warriors led by Achilleus. According to the Parian Chronicle, Phthia was the original home of the Hellenes, a name later given to the people previously known as Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the progenitor of the Hellenes, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who reigned in Phthia as the sole survivors following a catastrophic flood. This myth appears to have emerged as Greek tribes began to disperse to different regions of Greece, signifying their shared ancestry. Aristotle refers to ancient Hellas as an",
        "Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe still posed a significant threat, capable of causing extensive damage. The British were concerned about the potential impact of intensified submarine and air attacks on their sea communications due to the German occupation of Western Europe. The repercussions of such attacks succeeding could have altered the course of the war significantly. Liverpool, a crucial port for convoys transporting vital supplies from North America through the Western Approaches, was a prime target. During the Liverpool Blitz, successful operations by the Luftwaffe resulted in the sinking of 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping, with an additional 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison expressed concerns about the declining morale among civilians, pointing out signs of defeatism. Other reports indicated that half of the port's 144 berths were unusable, leading to a 75% reduction in cargo unloading capacity. The city's roads and railways were obstructed, and ships were stranded in the harbor. The devastating events of May 8, 1941, saw the destruction of 57 ships.",
        "During King George V's reign, the East Front of the building underwent significant renovation in 1913 by Sir Aston Webb to resemble parts of Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire, replacing Blore's 1850 design. The new principal façade, made of Portland stone, served as the setting for the Victoria Memorial, a large statue of Queen Victoria placed outside the main gates. Unlike his father, Edward VII, George V had a more serious demeanor, focusing more on official duties rather than extravagant parties. Under his reign, the palace hosted command performances featuring jazz legends like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong in 1932. This led to the palace receiving a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing its significant contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The temporary tranquility in Europe gave Napoleon the chance to shift his attention to the French overseas territories. Saint-Domingue had gained a significant degree of self-governance during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture establishing himself as the de facto ruler by 1801. Napoleon seized the opportunity to reclaim the once prosperous colony after the Treaty of Amiens was signed. Despite the National Convention's decision to end slavery in February 1794, Napoleon, under the terms of the Amiens agreement, yielded to British pressures by preserving slavery in colonies where the 1794 decree had not been enforced. The subsequent Law of 20 May excluded territories such as Guadeloupe and Guyane from the abolition of slavery, leading to unauthorized reinstatements of slavery by rogue military leaders and officials during the peacetime period. The Law of 20 May specifically reinstated the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies, rather than slavery itself. Napoleon dispatched General Leclerc on an expedition with the mission of",
        "The concept of Mary's absolute purity from the moment of her creation was a well-known belief among Greek theologians in Byzantium. Saint Gregory Nazianzen was among the early proponents of this idea, linking the notion of \"purification\" in the context of Jesus and Mary to their sinless nature. By interpreting the act of purification at the circumcision as a symbol of their immaculate state, Gregory referred to Mary as \"prepurified.\" This interpretation aimed to explain the holiness of both Jesus and Mary, suggesting that they were equally pure through divine grace. Gregory's teachings on Mary's purification likely emerged in response to the growing veneration of the Mother of God in Constantinople around Christmas. Consequently, his designation of Mary as \"prepurified\" was later embraced by others.",
        "The state enjoyed a sense of relative tranquility compared to the rest of the nation until 1841 due to its strong connections with the United States. However, in 1843, the state government foresaw the looming threat of war and took proactive measures to fortify the defense lines along the political border with Texas. They dispatched weapons and supplies to adequately equip the military and implemented strategies to enhance the efficiency of the presidios. Subsequently, the state established the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border, comprising light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small contingent of 14 men and 42 officials, with an annual cost of 160,603 pesos. In the early 1840s, private individuals attempted to obstruct the commercial caravans from the United States, but due to the distance from major suppliers in central Mexico, the caravans were allowed to continue in March 1844. As tensions persisted, the state legislature issued a decree on July 11, 1846, mobilizing 6,000 men in anticipation of potential conflict.",
        "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon led his soldiers across the Swiss Alps into Italy with the intention of catching the Austrian forces off guard. The Austrians had taken control of the region while Napoleon was away in Egypt. Despite the challenges faced during the treacherous Alpine crossing, the French army managed to advance into Northern Italy with little resistance. Simultaneously, another French army besieged Genoa, diverting the attention of the Austrian troops. This diversion, led by André Masséna, provided crucial time for the main French force to operate without significant opposition. Following days of maneuvering, the two armies finally clashed at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas held a numerical advantage with around 30,000 Austrian troops compared to Napoleon's 24,000 soldiers. Initially, the Austrians gained the upper hand, catching the French off guard and pushing them back. Melas believed he had achieved victory, but Napoleon had other plans.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans (or Danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (Argives: Αργείοι) are utilized to identify the Greek forces that opposed the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, originating from Egypt, serves as a foundational tale for Argos. Danaus' daughters, the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to endlessly carry water in a jug with holes. This narrative is interlinked with an eternal, unattainable task akin to that of Sisyphus, and the name Danaus may stem from the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river.\" Despite various hypotheses regarding their lineage, no definitive theory exists. Some researchers associate the Danaans with the Denyen, a faction of the seafaring people who besieged Egypt during the rule of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same historical inscription references the Weshesh, possibly corresponding to the Achaeans. The Denyen populace appears to have dwelled in the city of Adana in Cilicia. The pottery discovered bears a resemblance to that of...",
        "In 1969, Schwarzenegger crossed paths with Barbara Outland (later known as Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher whom he cohabitated with until 1974. Schwarzenegger reflected on Barbara in his 1977 memoir, highlighting the contrast in their desires for life; he described her as seeking a stable, ordinary life, while he acknowledged his own lack of balance and disdain for a conventional lifestyle. Baker characterized Schwarzenegger as a vibrant and adventurous individual, but noted a shift in his demeanor towards the end of their relationship, transforming into an egotistical figure whose self-importance became overwhelming. In her own 2006 memoir titled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak, Baker portrayed Schwarzenegger in a less flattering light, revealing aspects of their relationship dynamics. Despite the candid portrayal, Schwarzenegger not only contributed a foreword to Baker's book but also engaged in a three-hour meeting with her. Baker disclosed that she only discovered his infidelity post-breakup, shedding light on the tumultuous nature of their relationship.",
        "The environment in which an adolescent grows up significantly influences their process of forming identity. Despite a majority of adolescent research focusing on white, middle-class youths, studies indicate that individuals raised in more privileged backgrounds tend to navigate their identity development more successfully. Adolescence marks a critical phase in an individual's life, and recent demographic trends suggest that the transition to adulthood now spans a longer timeframe compared to the mid-20th century. Consequently, the period of youth, encompassing late adolescence to early adulthood, has gained prominence in the life course trajectory. This shift has underscored the importance of various factors in this developmental stage, including commitment, coping mechanisms, and the impact of social media on social identity formation. These elements are heavily influenced by the surrounding environment in which an adolescent is raised. Children from more affluent backgrounds are exposed to a wider array of opportunities and generally more favorable circumstances, shaping their development.",

During adolescence, individuals rapidly develop their social network and learn to differentiate between close friends and casual acquaintances. While forming strong emotional bonds with friends is a natural part of this process, it can become problematic if these friends lead them into risky situations, known as peer pressure. Adolescence is a pivotal phase for social development since adolescents are particularly susceptible to the influence of their close relationships. This period marks a transition where individuals begin to take charge of their decisions, making it a delicate time. The impact of peers on an individual becomes significant during this stage, emphasizing the importance of relationships in an adolescent's social maturation as they start to grasp the concept.",

Snakes, in turn, might be hunted by hawks. Predators are categorized by trophic levels, with herbivores or primary consumers feeding on autotrophs at the base of the food chain, while secondary consumers prey on heterotrophs like animals. Beyond secondary consumers, there are tertiary consumers that feed on carnivores, and the pattern continues. However, due to the diminishing energy transfer between levels, the chain typically spans up to five or six levels, rarely exceeding three trophic levels in some cases. For example, a lion preying on large herbivores like wildebeest.",
