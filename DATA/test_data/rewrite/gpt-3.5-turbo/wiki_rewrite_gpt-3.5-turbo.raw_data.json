        " Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is a large crustacean , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . \n",
        " The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the \" crusher \" , and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the crusher , and the right is the cutter . \n",
        " The exoskeleton is generally blue above , with spots that coalesce , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . \n",
        " The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : \n",
        " Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently moulted female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her pleopods . Females carrying eggs are said to be \" berried \" and can be found throughout the year . \n",
        " The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on zooplankton . This stage involves three moults and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a benthic lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . \n",
        " The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the \" midnight @-@ sun lobster \" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . \n",
        " Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer pagurus . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin , but the species did not become established there . \n",
        " Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – 492 ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the bacterium <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . \n",
        " Homarus gammarus is traditionally \" highly esteemed \" as a foodstuff and was mentioned in \" The <unk> \" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain \" excellent \" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the gastric mill and the \" sand vein \" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . \n",
        " Lobsters are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . \n",
        " H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including Astacus marinus Fabricius , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary Rathbun , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . \n",
        " The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a lectotype selected by <unk> Holthuis in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near Marstrand , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . \n",
        " Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam , CB , CBE ( 15 July 1914 – 23 December 1976 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born and educated in Tasmania , he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934 . He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the outbreak of World War II . In April 1941 , he became commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron , which operated Lockheed Hudsons . The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December , and saw action against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific . After returning to Australia in February 1942 , Headlam held staff appointments and training commands , finishing the war a group captain . \n",
        " Headlam served as Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in 1946 , and as Director of Training from 1947 to 1950 . In 1950 – 51 , during the Malayan Emergency , he was stationed at Singapore as commander of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing and , later , RAF Tengah . He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel , in 1957 and 1959 – 60 , receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958 . Promoted air vice marshal , he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command in 1961 – 62 , AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1965 – 66 , and AOC Support Command in 1966 – 67 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1965 . Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff from 1968 to 1971 , he retired from the Air Force and died in Melbourne five years later . \n",
        " The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda Headlam , Frank Headlam was born on 15 July 1914 in Launceston , Tasmania . He was schooled at <unk> College , Hobart , and matriculated in 1932 . Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934 . He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( FTS ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935 . \n",
        " After completing a conversion course , Headlam was assigned to the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre @-@ war RAAF , Seaplane Squadron was part of No. 1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes , among other types . During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with \" strong air forces , naval forces ( including submarines ) , and fixed defences , Australia may be made practically invulnerable \" . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , this paper \" in effect , defined the ' anti @-@ lodgment ' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking \" . \n",
        " Headlam completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 FTS . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . Commencing in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve @-@ day , 10 @,@ 800 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 700 mi ) round @-@ Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November . The following month , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a flight commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before transferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . \n",
        " Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south @-@ eastern Australia . Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15 January 1940 , when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer . On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul 's Anglican Church in Frankston ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . \n",
        " Headlam was given command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15 April 1941 , and raised to wing commander on 1 July . Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons , the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5 December , when four of its aircraft were ordered to Darwin , Northern Territory , in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific . On 7 December , this detachment established itself at Penfui , near Koepang in Dutch Timor , while No. 2 Squadron 's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby . The following day , aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific , one of the Penfui @-@ based Hudsons attacked the Japanese <unk> Nanyo Maru , which was suspected of being a radio ship , and forced it aground . By 12 December , Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base , as well as No. 2 Squadron . \n",
        " During January 1942 , No. 2 Squadron 's aircraft were dispersed at Penfui , <unk> Island , and Darwin . The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of Celebes . Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros . Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft . The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia . On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from Sparrow Force . He returned to Darwin the following day , just as the city experienced its first raid by the Japanese . Four of No. 2 Squadron 's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters , where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor . \n",
        " Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until 12 May 1942 , when he was posted to Nhill , Victoria , as commanding officer of No. 2 Air Navigation School , operating Ansons . No. 97 ( Reserve ) Squadron was formed from the school 's personnel in June . On 20 July 1943 , Headlam took command of No. 2 Air Observer School ( <unk> ) , also operating Ansons , at Mount Gambier , South Australia . He was promoted to group captain on 1 December 1943 , and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 <unk> , operating Ansons and Fairey Battles out of Port Pirie , on 9 December . After handing over command of No. 3 <unk> , he commenced studies at RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha , Victoria , on 2 October 1944 . He was appointed senior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command on 12 January 1945 . \n",
        " Headlam became Officer Commanding North @-@ Western Area in January 1946 . Posted to Britain at the end of the year , he attended the Royal Air Force Staff College , Andover , and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London . On his return to Australia , in November 1947 , he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters . In November 1950 , Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan . Headquartered at RAF Changi , Singapore , No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency : No. 1 ( Bomber ) Squadron , flying Avro Lincolns , and No. 38 ( Transport ) Squadron , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist @-@ held territory , as well as strikes against pinpoint targets . The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights , VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia , and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo , dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets . Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December , when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co @-@ piloting on a supply drop crash @-@ landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang , following engine failure . In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah , Singapore , in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing . Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951 . \n",
        " On 19 February 1952 , Headlam became senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith , New South Wales . During his term as SASO , the RAAF began re @-@ equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters . The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change , as it transitioned from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system to one based on function , resulting in the establishment of Home ( operational ) , Training , and Maintenance Commands . Eastern Area Command , considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control , was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953 . Headlam was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his \" exceptional ability and devotion to duty \" . He was promoted to acting air commodore in May . His appointment as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954 . \n",
        " Headlam was promoted to substantive air commodore on 1 January 1955 . In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia , he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air , Canberra , from 19 March to 21 October 1957 , between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan Walters , and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960 , between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely . In this role Headlam occupied a seat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee , chaired by businessman William John Allison , examining conditions of defence service ; the committee 's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay , among other improvements . Headlam 's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959 , and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959 . The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF 's Directorate of Intelligence . Headlam was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1958 Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June . In May 1960 he became acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . \n",
        " On 30 January 1961 , Headlam joined the staff of Operational Command ( OPCOM ) , the successor organisation to Home Command , responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units . He took over as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock in April . Headlam was promoted to air vice marshal on 29 May . On 17 July 1962 , he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaya , and took up the appointment of AOC No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later . He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch . As AOC No. 224 Group , Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962 , and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month . Divorced from his first wife in 1956 , he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964 . He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November . \n",
        " Returning to Australia , Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) \" in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories \" on 22 June . His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia . The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term , and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment . The year before , Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch , the Chief of the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy . Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbourne , on 8 August 1966 . Support Command had been formed in 1959 , by merging the RAAF 's former Training and Maintenance Commands . On 1 January 1968 , Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff . He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971 . \n",
        " Returning to Australia in June 1971 , Headlam took resettlement leave before retiring from the Air Force on 3 August . He made his home in Melbourne , where he died aged 62 on 23 December 1976 , after a lengthy battle with cancer . Survived by his children and his second wife , he was given a private funeral and cremated at Springvale Crematorium . \n",
        " M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between Fremont and Howard City . The section between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s . Various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past . The current route was finalized in the late 1970s \n",
        " M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont . This junction is at a tripoint of county lines . M @-@ 120 forms the north – south Newaygo – Oceana and Newaygo – Muskegon county lines . B @-@ 96 , which forms the east – west Oceana – Muskegon county line runs due west of the intersection . M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east . The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont . The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town . The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land . As the trunkline approaches Newaygo , the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River . M @-@ 82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 . The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street . South of downtown , M @-@ 82 turns east again , independent of M @-@ 37 , and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the Manistee National Forest . The east end of M @-@ 82 is at exit 118 on US 131 / M @-@ 46 west of Howard City . \n",
        " The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ 532 vehicles daily . The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ 018 vehicles east of Newaygo . In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . \n",
        " The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , shortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . \n",
        " Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County . M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of Hesperia , to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia . M @-@ 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City . M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 . The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current highway routing . \n",
        " Shikamaru Nara ( <unk> <unk> , Nara Shikamaru ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto . In the anime and manga , Shikamaru is a ninja affiliated with the village of Konohagakure . He is a member of Team 10 , a group of ninja consisting of himself , <unk> <unk> , Ino Yamanaka , and team leader Asuma Sarutobi . Shikamaru is portrayed as a lazy character , unwilling to apply his prodigious intelligence ; Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature . Outside of the Naruto anime and manga , Shikamaru has appeared in four of the feature films in the series , as well as several other media relating to the series , including video games and original video animations . \n",
        " Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Shikamaru 's character . Many reviewers commented on his laziness and intelligence , and noted his transformation into a leader ; Anime News Network celebrated Shikamaru 's emergence as \" an unlikely hero \" in the Naruto storyline . Shikamaru has also been highly popular with the Naruto reader base , placing high in several popularity polls . Merchandise based on Shikamaru has been released , including action figures , key chains , and patches . \n",
        " Masashi Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius , and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha 's intelligent but abrasive personality . Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl , noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life . When designing Shikamaru 's Part II appearance , Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series . As a result , he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair . \n",
        " Shikamaru first major appearance in the series is during the Chunin Exams , bi @-@ yearly exams for ninja who wish to advance in rank . He is part of Team 10 alongside <unk> <unk> and Ino Yamanaka . He is a highly unenthusiastic person , and he attempts to go through life with minimum effort . Contrary to his lazy tendencies , Shikamaru is extremely intelligent ; his teacher , Asuma Sarutobi , determined that Shikamaru 's IQ was over 200 . Shikamaru 's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Technique ( <unk> , <unk> no Jutsu , English TV : \" Shadow Possession Jutsu \" ) , the signature technique of his clan , with which he merges his shadow with an opponent 's shadow , making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru 's movements . As the series progresses , Shikamaru becomes able to manipulate his shadow in new ways . By Part II of the series , Shikamaru is capable of utilizing multiple shadow @-@ based techniques at once and can lift his shadow from the ground in order to interact with physical objects ; for instance , he can pierce enemies with the shadow tendrils or use them to throw weapons . \n",
        " Shikamaru approaches the exams with a sense of apathy ; when he battles the Sunagakure ninja Temari , he defeats her but forfeits his match to her , due to his chakra being low . Despite this loss , he is the only ninja among his peers to be promoted to the rank of Chunin , as the overseers of the exams were impressed by the insight and intelligence he demonstrated against Temari . As a Chunin , Shikamaru is appointed the leader of a team to prevent Sasuke Uchiha from defecting to the village of Otogakure . Although Shikamaru 's team manages to defeat the Otogakure ninja barring their way , Sasuke manages to escape . \n",
        " In Part II of the series , Shikamaru is assigned the task of locating two members of the criminal organization Akatsuki . While his team manages to find their targets , the immortal Akatsuki member <unk> kills Asuma Sarutobi during the course of the battle despite Shikamaru 's best efforts . After Asuma 's funeral , Shikamaru sets out with the surviving members of Team 10 to avenge their mentor with the aid of Kakashi Hatake . As the other deal with <unk> 's partner <unk> , Shikamaru avenges Asuma by defeating <unk> and making sure the Akatsuki member 's body is never found . Following the fight , Shikamaru vows to protect Kurenai <unk> and Asuma 's newborn daughter . He is later assigned to the Fourth Division alongside Temari and <unk> .

        " Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have commented on Shikamaru 's character . IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series , and referred to him as \" the poster child for any card @-@ carrying member of Generation X \" due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential . In a review of episode 110 , IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair . Anime News Network also commented on this development , calling Shikamaru 's emergence as \" an unlikely hero \" one of the highlights of the arc .

Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries , one for whites and one for African Americans . The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era . \n",
        " The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . Jimmie Rodgers , the \" Father of Country Music \" , was born in Meridian . Highland Park houses a museum which displays memorabilia of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . The park is also home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel , a National Historic Landmark . It is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence . Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin , James Chaney – an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 , and Hartley Peavey , founder of Peavey Electronics headquartered in Meridian . The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966 @-@ 1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing . \n",
        " Previously inhabited by the Choctaw Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian Removal . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . \n",
        " After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , Richard McLemore , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of McLemore 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from Kemper County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . Ragsdale and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . \n",
        " There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name \" Meridian , \" believing the term to be synonymous with \" junction \" ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred \" <unk> \" ( meaning \" mad river \" in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and Ragsdale proposed \" Ragsdale City . \" Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between \" Meridian \" and \" <unk> \" each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left \" Meridian \" on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . \n",
        " Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William Tecumseh Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , \" Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and cantonments no longer exists . \" Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . \n",
        " The town boomed in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its \" Golden Age \" from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the Wechsler School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . \n",
        " The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to \" provide luxury to the common man , \" opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal courthouse was built in 1933 as a WPA project . \n",
        " After a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . \n",
        " During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James Chaney and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , Chaney , <unk> , and Goodman went to Neshoba County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . \n",
        " Seven Klansmen , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \" depriving the victims of their civil rights \" and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted \" a white official in a civil rights killing . \" In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . \n",
        " Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . \n",
        " Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . \" \n",
        " After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown . \n",
        " Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its \" Golden Age , \" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . \n",
        " As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . \n",
        " The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . \n",
        " As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . Rehabilitation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events . \n",
        " Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts , the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District .

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss , famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building . Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his <unk> Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino . One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills . \n",

        " Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools .

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 .

Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , stacks , arches , blowholes , and cliffs . The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation . \n",

Lord Thorvald <unk> is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to \" preserve \" his daughter from men . Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman sweetheart successfully eloped .

To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf scalping ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . \n",

At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone , laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier Silurian rocks , uplifted by the formation of Pangaea , eroded and then were deposited into river deltas . The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava ( rhyolite ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation . \n",

In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish lairds , Thomas Gifford of Busta , and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ oared boats known as <unk> . \n",
        " The island church , which overlooks Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore Wick , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> kirk ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as \" the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century \" . There is a tradition that the work there was interfered with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the cornerstones were moved overnight by these unearthly agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of rhyolite and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . \n",
        " In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West Voe was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . \n",
        " There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or Clack Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone , and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below . Some were still in use on Papa Stour in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south Mainland of Shetland . \n",
        " In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa Stour 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. Mingulay ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . \n",
        " The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , foundered on the Ve Skerries 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of Scalloway to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries . A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. <unk> , which were buried in Scalloway . \n",
        " The cargo ship SS Highcliffe ran aground in fog on <unk> Holm in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were clement and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler Juniper ran aground in Lyra Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the coxswain being awarded the RNLI silver medal for this rescue . \n",
        " Papa Stour 's most recent shipwreck occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , skipper Alec Flett , foundered on the Ve Skerries . The <unk> Lifeboat came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions . At the request of Alec Webster , Coastguard Station Officer , Lerwick , a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky <unk> helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled . They managed to winch all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the grounding , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at Sumburgh Airport . \n",
        " Crofting is the mainstay of island life . Sheep form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and geese . Vegetable are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as ' <unk> scrubs ' . Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale . There is a post office at the pier , but no shop . Mains electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century . The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues . Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West <unk> on the Shetland Mainland . The crossing takes 45 minutes , and although the <unk> carries cars , there is only one short road on the <unk> visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care . \n",
        " It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The insistent chorus chant , ' <unk> Foula Doon ! ' , is particularly striking . \n",
        " \" <unk> Foula <unk> ! \" refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa Stour . The ' tide @-@ lumps ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature . \n",
        " \" Angel of Death \" is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood .

        " Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , \" Angel of Death \" is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a \" classic \" . \n",
        " Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote \" Angel of Death \" after reading books about Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band : \" I remember stopping someplace where I bought two books on Mengele . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . \" \n",
        " The lyrics detail Mengele 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . Mengele 's explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in \" Angel of Death \" are experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , gassing , injections with lethal germs , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . \n",
        " \" <unk> together , joining heads .

        "Homarus gammarus, commonly referred to as the European lobster, is a type of clawed lobster found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and certain areas of the Black Sea. This species, closely related to the American lobster (H. americanus), can reach sizes of up to 60 cm (24 in) in length and weigh as much as 6 kilograms (13 lb), featuring a distinctive pair of claws. While alive, these lobsters display a blue hue, turning to the classic \"lobster red\" color when cooked. Breeding typically takes place during the summer months, with females carrying eggs for nearly a year until they hatch into planktonic larvae. Highly prized as a culinary delicacy, Homarus gammarus is predominantly harvested using lobster pots, particularly in the vicinity of the British Isles.",
        "Homarus gammarus is a sizable crustacean, reaching a body length of up to 60 centimetres (24 in) and a weight of 5-6 kilograms (11-13 lb). However, lobsters typically caught in traps are around 23-38 cm (9-15 in) long and weigh between 0.7-2.2 kg (1.5-4.9 lb). Similar to other crustaceans, lobsters possess a tough exoskeleton that they must shed to facilitate growth, a process known as ecdysis or moulting. While young lobsters may undergo this process multiple times a year, larger specimens typically moult once every 1-2 years.",
        "The initial set of pereiopods features a significant, unevenly sized pair of claws. One claw, known as the \"crusher,\" is larger and equipped with rounded nodules designed for crushing prey, while the other, called the \"cutter,\" has sharp inner edges for gripping or tearing the prey. Typically, the crusher is situated on the left side, with the cutter on the right.",
        "The exoskeleton is typically blue on top, merging into spots, and yellow underneath. The red hue seen in cooked lobsters is due to the breakdown of the protein complex that binds the red astaxanthin pigment when exposed to heat, releasing the red pigment.",
        "The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is the most closely related species to H. gammarus. Despite their strong resemblance and the possibility of artificial hybridization, natural interbreeding in the wild is rare due to their non-overlapping habitats. Several distinguishing features differentiate these two species.",
        "Female H. gammarus become sexually mature when their carapace length reaches 80 to 85 millimeters (3.1 to 3.3 inches), while males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating usually takes place in the summer between a female that has recently molted, making her shell soft, and a male with a hard shell. The female carries the eggs attached to her pleopods for about 12 months, with the duration influenced by the temperature. Females carrying eggs, known as \"berried,\" can be observed at any time of the year.",
        "The eggs typically hatch during the night, and the larvae then migrate to the water surface, where they passively drift with the ocean currents, feeding on zooplankton. This larval stage consists of three molts and spans a period of 15 to 35 days. Following the third molt, the young creatures assume a more adult-like form and transition to a benthic existence. Although sightings of these juveniles are rare in their natural habitat, they are known to possess the ability to excavate extensive burrows. It is estimated that only about 1 larva in every 20,000 successfully reaches the benthic phase. Upon reaching a carapace length of 15 mm (0.59 in), the juveniles emerge from their burrows and embark on their adult lives.",
        "Homarus gammarus is distributed throughout the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, excluding the Baltic Sea. It can be found in most parts of the Mediterranean Sea, with the exception of the region east of Crete, and along the northwestern coast of the Black Sea. The species is also present in the Norwegian fjords and in the Arctic Circle, with the northernmost populations residing there.",
        "The species can be categorized into four genetically separate populations: one that is widespread, and three that have evolved separately likely because of small effective population sizes, potentially in response to local environmental conditions. The initial group includes lobsters from northern Norway, known as the \"midnight-sun lobster.\" The populations in the Mediterranean Sea differ from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The final unique population is located in the Netherlands: specimens from the area were distinguishable from those gathered in the North Sea or English Channel.",
        "Efforts have been undertaken to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand, along with other European species like the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. From 1904 to 1914, a million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species failed to establish itself in the region.",
        "Fully grown H. gammarus are typically found on the continental shelf, usually inhabiting depths ranging from 0 to 150 meters, with a tendency not to venture beyond 50 meters. They exhibit a preference for solid surfaces like rocks or compact mud, residing within crevices or burrows and emerging during the night for feeding activities.",
        "The disease <unk>, which is caused by the bacterium <unk> <unk>, is known to affect Homarus gammarus. While it is commonly found in American lobsters, cases of the disease have only been observed in captive H. gammarus, with the possibility of previous occupation of the tanks by H. americanus.",
        "Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster, has long been held in high regard as a culinary delicacy and even found its way into a seventeenth-century English folk song. This species commands premium prices and is available fresh, frozen, canned, or as a powder. The white meat, described as excellent, can be found in both the claws and abdomen, while most of the cephalothorax is also edible. The only inedible parts are the gastric mill and the gut, also known as the \"sand vein.\" Notably, the European lobster can cost up to three times more than its American counterpart, Homarus americanus, due to its superior flavor profile.",
        "Lobsters are primarily caught using lobster pots, although occasionally they can be lured out by lines baited with octopus or cuttlefish to facilitate capture with a net or by hand. In 2008, a total of 4,386 tonnes of H. gammarus were harvested in Europe and North Africa, with the British Isles (including the Channel Islands) accounting for 3,462 tonnes (79%). The required minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm (3.4 inches).",
        "H. gammarus has been designated as the type species of the genus Homarus Weber, 1795, following Direction 51 by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Confusion had previously arisen due to the species being known by various names, such as Astacus marinus Fabricius, 1775, and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne-Edwards, 1837. Additionally, Friedrich Weber's genus description was overlooked until its rediscovery by Mary Rathbun, thereby invalidating any previous assignments of type species (Homarus H. Milne-Edwards, 1837) for Homarus Weber, 1795.",
        "In 1974, <unk> Holthuis designated a lectotype for Homarus gammarus, which originated from 57°53′N 11°32′E, close to Marstrand, Sweden (approximately 48 kilometers or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg). Unfortunately, both the lectotype and the original specimen have been misplaced.",
        "Air Vice Marshal Frank Headlam, CB, CBE (15 July 1914 – 23 December 1976), was a high-ranking officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He was born and raised in Tasmania and enlisted in the RAAF as an air cadet in January 1934. Prior to the start of World War II, he focused on flight instruction and navigation. In April 1941, he assumed command of No. 2 Squadron, which was equipped with Lockheed Hudsons. The squadron was sent to Dutch Timor in December and engaged in combat against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific. Upon their return to Australia in February 1942, Headlam took on various administrative roles and training positions, ultimately concluding the war as a group captain.",
        "Headlam held various key military positions throughout his career. He was the Officer Commanding North-Western Area in 1946, Director of Training from 1947 to 1950, and during the Malayan Emergency in 1950-51, he commanded No. 90 (Composite) Wing and RAF Tengah in Singapore. He also acted as Air Member for Personnel twice, in 1957 and 1959-60, and was honored as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1958. Subsequently promoted to air vice marshal, he served in roles such as Air Officer Commanding Operational Command in 1961-62, AOC No. 224 Group RAF from 1962 to 1965 during the Indonesia-Malaysia Konfrontasi, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1965-66, and AOC Support Command in 1966-67. In recognition of his contributions, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1965. After completing his role as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London from 1968 to 1971, he retired from the Air Force and passed away in Melbourne five years later.",
        "Frank Headlam, the son of Malcolm and Hilda Headlam, was born on 15 July 1914 in Launceston, Tasmania. He received his education at <unk> College in Hobart and graduated in 1932. Despite his parents' objections, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934. He received flight training at No. 1 Flying Training School (FTS) located at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, and was appointed as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935.",
        "Upon completing a conversion course, Headlam was designated to the Seaplane Squadron located at Point Cook. Described as no more than a flight in the official history of the pre-war RAAF, the Seaplane Squadron was a component of No. 1 FTS and utilized various aircraft such as Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes. It was during this assignment that Headlam was elevated to the rank of flying officer on 1 July 1935. Noteworthy is the paper he authored on national defense during this time, proposing that Australia could achieve near invulnerability by bolstering its air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defenses. As noted by Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper essentially laid the groundwork for the enduring 'anti-lodgment' concept in RAAF strategic planning.",
        "In July 1936, Headlam successfully completed a flying instructors course and became a part of the staff at No. 1 FTS. His promotion to flight lieutenant took place on 1 March 1937. Starting in July 1938, he participated in the RAAF's inaugural Long Specialist Navigation Course held at Point Cook, led by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch. The course included a series of challenging training flights that garnered significant media coverage, such as a noteworthy twelve-day, 10,800-kilometer round-Australia journey involving three Avro Ansons, with Headlam piloting one of them in November. The subsequent month, he guided the Ansons on a six-day expedition across Central Australia. Headlam excelled in the navigation course, earning a special distinction upon completion. On 27 January 1939, he assumed the role of a flight commander at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Initially assigned to No. 2 Squadron, he later moved to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August, both of which operated Ansons.",
        "After the start of World War II, No. 1 Squadron was involved in escorting convoys and conducting maritime reconnaissance missions off the southeastern coast of Australia. Headlam remained with the squadron as a flight commander until January 15, 1940, when he was reassigned to Headquarters Laverton as the navigation officer. By March 27, he was transferred to the RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. His rank was elevated to squadron leader on June 1, 1940. Shortly after, he wed Katherine Bridge at St Paul's Anglican Church in Frankston. They later had a son and a daughter.",
        "Headlam took over the command of No. 2 Squadron at Laverton on 15th April 1941 and was promoted to wing commander on 1st July the same year. The squadron, equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, primarily conducted maritime patrols in the southern waters until 5th December. At that point, following concerns of Japanese aggression in the Pacific, four aircraft from the squadron were dispatched to Darwin, Northern Territory. On 7th December, this group set up base at Penfui near Koepang in Dutch Timor, while the remaining eight Hudsons of No. 2 Squadron were put on standby in Darwin. The next day, upon the declaration of war in the Pacific, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons took action against the suspected radio ship Nanyo Maru, forcing it to run aground. By 12th December, Headlam had moved to Penfui, assuming command of both the base and No. 2 Squadron.",
        "In January 1942, No. 2 Squadron had its aircraft dispersed across Penfui, <unk> Island, and Darwin. The Penfui detachment engaged in combat with Japanese forces involved in the Celebes invasion. During an attack on a transport ship on 11 January, two Hudsons successfully took down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes, but were later shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros on the following day. Penfui was first bombed by the Japanese on 26 January 1942 and continued to be a target, resulting in damage to some aircraft. While the intact Hudsons were relocated to Darwin, Headlam and his team remained at Penfui to assist in reconnaissance missions from Australia. Eventually, on 18 February, Headlam received orders to evacuate all personnel except for a small group tasked with demolishing the airfield with Sparrow Force's support. He returned to Darwin the next day, coinciding with the city's initial Japanese air raid. Subsequently, four of No. 2 Squadron's Hudsons were lost in the attack, prompting the relocation of the remaining aircraft to Daly Waters for further reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.",
        "Headlam continued his service in Darwin as the Controller of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until May 12, 1942. He then moved to Nhill, Victoria, to lead No. 2 Air Navigation School, where Ansons were in operation. In June, No. 97 (Reserve) Squadron was established using personnel from the school. Subsequently, on July 20, 1943, Headlam assumed command of No. 2 Air Observer School at Mount Gambier, South Australia, also utilizing Ansons. His promotion to group captain occurred on December 1, 1943, followed by his appointment as the first commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron, operating Ansons and Fairey Battles from Port Pirie, on December 9. After relinquishing command of No. 3 Squadron, he enrolled in RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha, Victoria, on October 2, 1944. Later, on January 12, 1945, he was designated as the senior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command.",
        "Headlam took on the role of Officer Commanding North-Western Area in January 1946. Towards the end of that year, he was stationed in Britain where he attended the Royal Air Force Staff College in Andover and worked at RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London. Upon his return to Australia in November 1947, he assumed the position of Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, he was tasked with leading No. 90 (Composite) Wing, succeeding Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Based at RAF Changi in Singapore, No. 90 Wing oversaw RAAF units involved in operations during the Malayan Emergency: No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron, which flew Avro Lincolns, and No. 38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Avro Lincolns carried out bombing missions over communist-held areas and targeted specific locations. The Douglas Dakotas were responsible for courier services, VIP transportation, medical evacuations across Southeast Asia, troop and cargo airlifts in Malaya, supply drops to friendly forces, and dissemination of propaganda leaflets. Headlam sustained minor injuries on December 20 when a Dakota from No. 38 Squadron, which he was co-piloting, crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang due to engine failure. In August 1951, he was appointed as the commander of RAF Tengah in Singapore while still holding the position of commanding officer of No. 90 Wing. Headlam relinquished command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951.",
        "On 19th February 1952, Headlam assumed the role of senior air staff officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith, New South Wales. During his tenure as SASO, the RAAF initiated the adoption of English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. The Air Force underwent a significant restructuring, shifting from a location-based command-and-control system to a functional one, leading to the establishment of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. Recognized as a de facto operational headquarters due to its control over numerous combat units, Eastern Area Command was restructured as Home Command in October 1953. In recognition of his outstanding skills and dedication, Headlam was honored as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours. He was subsequently promoted to acting air commodore in May and appointed as aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II on 7th October 1954.",
        "On 1 January 1955, Headlam was elevated to the rank of substantive air commodore. Subsequently, he was assigned to RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London in November and attended courses at the Imperial Defence College the following year. Upon his return to Australia, he assumed the role of acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air in Canberra, serving between 19 March and 21 October 1957, and then again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960. During these periods, Headlam held a position on the Air Board, the governing body of the service chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He also represented the RAAF on a committee, led by William John Allison, which evaluated defense service conditions, resulting in enhanced benefits such as a doubled flight pay. Headlam's responsibilities at the Department of Air included serving as Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and as Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959, overseeing the RAAF's Directorate of Intelligence. In recognition of his contributions, Headlam was honored as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, announced on 3 June. His career progression continued as he assumed the role of acting Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in May 1960.",
        "On 30 January 1961, Headlam began working at Operational Command (OPCOM), which had replaced Home Command and oversaw the direction of RAAF operational units. In April, he assumed the role of Air Officer Commanding (AOC) OPCOM, succeeding Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock. He was promoted to air vice marshal on 29 May. Headlam was then assigned to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaya on 17 July 1962, where he took on the position of AOC No. 224 Group RAF in Singapore a week later. Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch took over as AOC OPCOM. While serving as AOC No. 224 Group, Headlam was responsible for regional air defense and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962, and the subsequent Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia the following month. After divorcing his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964. He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris on 30 November.",
        "Upon his return to Australia, Headlam assumed the position of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) on 26 January 1965. He was honored as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 22 June for his exceptional service in the Borneo Territories. During his tenure as DCAS, the Air Force engaged in its most significant rearmament effort since World War II. The Air Force faced challenges due to manpower shortages resulting from its expanded operations in Southeast Asia. Towards the end of his term, the first RAAF helicopters were deployed to the Vietnam War. Headlam, alongside Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, traveled to Saigon in March 1966 to strategize the deployment. His subsequent role as AOC Support Command in Melbourne, succeeding Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy on 8 August 1966, involved overseeing the amalgamation of the RAAF’s former Training and Maintenance Commands. In January 1968, Headlam assumed the position of Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. Additionally, he served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971.",
        "Headlam returned to Australia in June 1971 and then proceeded to take resettlement leave. Subsequently, he retired from the Air Force on 3 August. Settling in Melbourne, he passed away at the age of 62 on 23 December 1976 after bravely fighting cancer for an extended period. He is survived by his children and his second wife. A private funeral was held in his honor, and he was cremated at Springvale Crematorium.",

Passing through Fremont and along the southern boundary of Manistee National Forest, the route has a history dating back to the 1920s. Originally established in the Upper Peninsula in 1919, M-82 has undergone alterations over the years, with terminus changes as far west as New Era or Hesperia. The current alignment was settled in the late 1970s.",
        "M-82 commences at an intersection with M-120 and B-96, located west of Fremont, where the county lines converge. M-120 delineates the north-south boundaries of Newaygo-Oceana and Newaygo-Muskegon counties. On the other hand, B-96, which marks the east-west division of Oceana-Muskegon counties, stretches directly west from this crossroads. To the east of the intersection, M-82 follows 48th Street, passing through agricultural landscapes before reaching Fremont. Upon entering the town, the road transforms into Main Street, traversing the downtown area until M-82 veers south onto Stewart Avenue. Continuing eastward on 72nd Street, the highway meanders through more farmland until it nears Newaygo, where the surroundings become increasingly wooded near the Muskegon River. Upon reaching Newaygo, M-82 follows Fremont Street to meet M-37, merging briefly to cross the river into downtown via State Street. South of the city center, M-82 turns eastward, diverging from M-37, and proceeds along 82nd Street, bordering the southern edge of the Manistee National Forest. Finally, the eastern terminus of M-82 is located at exit 118 on US 131/M-46, situated west of Howard City.",
        "As part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) monitors traffic levels on its roadways using a metric known as average annual daily traffic (AADT), which calculates the daily traffic average on a road segment throughout the year. In 2009, MDOT's data revealed that a section of M-82, located west of Fremont, recorded the highest traffic volume on the highway at 16,532 vehicles per day, while the lowest traffic volume was observed at 4,018 vehicles east of Newaygo. Furthermore, none of MDOT's highway sections have been included in the National Highway System, a network of roads crucial for the nation's economy, defense, and transportation.",
        "The present-day M-82, established in 1926, originally connected US 31 in Hart to the northern intersection of US 131 and M-46 in Howard City, passing through Ferry, Hesperia, and Fremont, replacing the former M-41 route. In the late 1930s, M-46 was prolonged to include the segment between Newaygo and Howard City, resulting in a shared M-46/M-82 route to bridge a gap in the M-46 pathway. By 1938, this shared stretch became solely designated as M-46, resulting in M-82 being truncated back to the northern junction of M-37 in Newaygo. In the late 1940s, or early 1948, the highway was relocated to a new course west of Ferry, extending westward to its new terminus in Shelby instead of its initial direction towards Hart.",
        "In 1963 and 1964, there were two realignments that altered the western section of the highway once again, redirecting it from Hesperia to New Era, bypassing Ferry. A significant change occurred around 1969 when highway designations in Oceana County were revamped. M-20 took over the section west of Hesperia previously designated as M-82, now terminating at New Era instead of Muskegon. M-120 was introduced to replace M-20 south of Hesperia. Consequently, M-82's route was shortened to only run from Hesperia to Newaygo. The highway's length was extended in 1973 by relocating its eastern end back to Howard City. M-46 was rerouted to run along the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs, replacing M-57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia. This adjustment allowed the highway between Newaygo and Howard City to revert to the M-82 designation. The final modification occurred in 1978 when the overlap with M-120 was removed in favor of M-120 solely. At that time, the M-82 designation was cut back to the junction west of Fremont, establishing the current highway configuration.",
        "Shikamaru Nara, also known as Nara Shikamaru, is a character from the Naruto manga and anime series by Masashi Kishimoto. In the series, Shikamaru is a ninja from the village of Konohagakure and a member of Team 10 along with Choji Akimichi, Ino Yamanaka, and their leader Asuma Sarutobi. Despite his exceptional intelligence, Shikamaru is depicted as lazy and often avoids using his abilities. Kishimoto appreciates Shikamaru's laid-back personality. Apart from the original series, Shikamaru has made appearances in four Naruto films and various other related media such as video games and original animations.",
        "Shikamaru's character has been extensively discussed in various anime and manga sources.

        "Masashi Kishimoto has expressed his fondness for Shikamaru, appreciating his relaxed demeanor alongside his exceptional intelligence. He contrasted Shikamaru with Sasuke Uchiha, who possesses intellect but displays a more abrasive personality. Kishimoto humorously mentioned that if he were a girl, he would marry Shikamaru, acknowledging Shikamaru's potential for success in life. In creating Shikamaru's appearance in Part II, Kishimoto aimed to give him a distinctive look despite outfitting him with a common ninja vest seen in the series. To maintain this uniqueness, he placed Shikamaru's forehead protector on his arm to keep his hair visible.",
        "Shikamaru makes his first significant appearance in the series during the Chunin Exams, which are bi-annual tests for ninjas aiming to progress in rank. He belongs to Team 10 with Choji Akimichi and Ino Yamanaka. Despite his strong aversion to putting in effort, Shikamaru is remarkably intelligent; his mentor, Asuma Sarutobi, estimated his IQ to be over 200. His skills revolve around the Shadow Imitation Technique, the trademark ability of his clan. This technique allows him to merge his shadow with an opponent's, rendering them immobile and compelled to mirror Shikamaru's actions. As the storyline advances, Shikamaru refines his shadow manipulation techniques. In the later part of the series, he demonstrates the capacity to execute multiple shadow-based tactics simultaneously and raise his shadow from the ground to interact with physical objects. For instance, he can impale foes with shadow tendrils or employ them to hurl weapons.",
        "Approaching the exams with a lack of enthusiasm, Shikamaru faces Temari from Sunagakure in a battle where he emerges victorious but opts to concede the match due to depleted chakra levels. Despite this setback, he stands out among his peers and gets promoted to Chunin, as the exam proctors were impressed by his strategic prowess exhibited during the fight with Temari. Assigned as the leader of a team, Shikamaru's mission is to stop Sasuke Uchiha from joining Otogakure village. While his team successfully defeats the Otogakure ninjas obstructing their path, Sasuke still manages to evade capture.",
        "In the second part of the series, Shikamaru is given the mission to locate two individuals affiliated with the criminal group Akatsuki. Despite the successful identification of their targets by his team, one of the Akatsuki's immortal members fatally wounds Asuma Sarutobi during the confrontation, despite Shikamaru's valiant efforts. After bidding farewell to Asuma at his funeral, Shikamaru embarks on a quest for vengeance alongside the surviving members of Team 10, aided by Kakashi Hatake. While the rest of the team confronts Akatsuki's associate, Shikamaru ensures justice for Asuma by defeating the immortal member and ensuring their body remains unrecoverable. Following this intense battle, Shikamaru pledges to safeguard Kurenai and Asuma's infant daughter. He later joins the Fourth Division with Temari and others, serving as a deputy general under Gaara. In the series' conclusion, after revealing his personal aspirations during the final battles, Shikamaru marries Temari and becomes the advisor to the Seventh Hokage, Naruto, and welcomes a son named <unk> Nara into their family.",

        "Meridian, located in Mississippi, is the state's sixth-largest city. It serves as the county seat of Lauderdale County and is the primary city in the Meridian, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area. Positioned along key highways, Meridian is situated 93 miles (150 km) east of Jackson, Mississippi; 154 miles (248 km) west of Birmingham, Alabama; 202 miles (325 km) northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana; and 231 miles (372 km) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee.",
        "Founded in 1860 at the junction of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi, Meridian thrived as a pivotal trading hub reliant on the railways for transportation of goods. However, during the Battle of Meridian in February 1864, General William Tecumseh Sherman destroyed a significant portion of the city during the American Civil War.",
        "After the war, the city underwent significant reconstruction, leading to a period of prosperity known as its \"Golden Age.\" Between 1890 and 1930, it emerged as the largest city in Mississippi and a prominent industrial hub in the Southern region, boasting a daily influx and outflux of 44 trains. The construction of Union Station in 1906 transformed it into a modern multi-modal transportation center, facilitating access to the Meridian Transit System, Greyhound Buses, and Trailways, accommodating an average of 242,360 passengers annually. While the city's economy initially suffered from the railroad sector's decline, it has since diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing emerging as the primary employers by 2010. As per 2008 census data, the city's population within its boundaries is estimated at 38,232. However, the city's economy is also supported by a larger population of 232,900 within a 45-mile radius and 526,500 within a 65-mile radius, with 104,600 and 234,200 individuals in the respective labor forces.",
        "The region is supported by two military bases, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, generating employment for over 4,000 individuals. NAS Meridian houses the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA) and the inaugural Department of Homeland Security at the local level in the state. Key Field, named after Fred and Al Key, who achieved a global endurance flight record in 1935, currently accommodates the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and serves as a base for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. Rush Foundation Hospital stands as the primary non-military employer in the area, with a workforce of 2,610.",
        "Meridian boasts a variety of arts institutions and historic edifices such as the Riley Center, the Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. The city once housed two Carnegie libraries, distinct for white and African American patrons. The Carnegie Branch Library, which no longer stands, was part of a series of Carnegie libraries constructed for Black communities in the South during the period of segregation.",
        "Meridian, known as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers, the \"Father of Country Music,\" has been chosen as the future site of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center. The city's Highland Park features a museum exhibiting memorabilia from Rodgers' life, as well as historic railroad equipment from the steam-engine era. Additionally, Highland Park is home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel, recognized as a National Historic Landmark and the only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie carousel in the world. Notable Meridian natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin, civil rights activist James Chaney, who tragically lost his life in the 1964 Mississippi civil rights workers murders, and Hartley Peavey, the founder of Peavey Electronics headquartered in Meridian. The federal courthouse in the city was the venue for the 1966-1967 trial of the suspects involved in the murder of Chaney and two other activists, marking the first instance where a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights crime.",
        "Once home to the Choctaw Native Americans, the region known today as Meridian was acquired by the United States in 1830 through the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek as part of the Indian Removal era. Following the treaty's approval, European American pioneers started to settle in the area.",
        "Upon being granted approximately 2,000 acres (810 ha) of federal land, Richard McLemore, the original settler of Meridian, initiated the practice of granting free land to newcomers with the aim of attracting more residents to the area and fostering its growth. The bulk of McLemore's land was acquired in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale, an attorney from Alabama, while the remaining 80 acres (0.32 km2) were purchased by John T. Ball, a merchant from Kemper County. Ragsdale and Ball, credited as the city's pioneers, proceeded to divide their respective land portions to create parcels for new urban development.",
        "There was a fierce rivalry concerning the suggested name for the town. The residents were divided, with Ball and the more industrial members supporting the name \"Meridian,\" associating it with \"junction.\" On the other hand, the agrarian group favored \"<unk>,\" derived from a local creek's name meaning \"mad river\" in a Native American language. Ragsdale suggested \"Ragsdale City.\" To resolve the dispute, Ball installed a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad with a sign that alternated daily between \"Meridian\" and \"<unk>.\" Eventually, the increasing number of railroad workers influenced the decision, leading to the permanent placement of \"Meridian\" on the station sign. The town was formally established as Meridian on February 10, 1860, following its incorporation.",
        "Meridian, a small village at the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, held a crucial position at a railroad junction, prompting the Confederates to erect multiple military facilities to aid in the war efforts. In 1864, during the Battle of Meridian, General William Tecumseh Sherman led his troops into the town, demolishing the railways in all directions, as well as an arsenal and vast storage facilities; a significant portion of the structures were set ablaze by his troops. Sherman was quoted as stating post-event, \"Meridian, along with its depots, warehouses, arsenal, hospitals, offices, hotels, and barracks, no longer survives.\" Despite the devastation, the city's rail lines were swiftly restored and operational within 26 days of the battle. Racial tensions persisted throughout the Reconstruction period, culminating in the 1871 riot subsequent to a fire that inflicted damage on numerous businesses.",
        "Following the Civil War, the town thrived and reached its peak known as the \"Golden Age\" between 1880 and 1910. The introduction of railroads in the region not only facilitated transportation but also attracted various industries, leading to a surge in the population. With the growing number of residents, commercial activities flourished in the downtown area. From 1890 to 1930, Meridian held the distinction of being the largest city in Mississippi and emerged as a prominent manufacturing hub in the Southern region. Numerous iconic landmarks in the city, such as the Grand Opera House constructed in 1890, the Wechsler School in 1894, two Carnegie libraries in 1913, and the <unk> Building, which became Meridian's tallest skyscraper in 1929, were built during or shortly after this prosperous period.",
        "The city's expansion was fueled by the proactive measures of the commission government, which facilitated the establishment of 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and the flourishing automobile sector in the 1920s. Despite the economic downturn triggered by the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, the city remained attractive to prospective businesses. In line with the era's trend of seeking solace from harsh realities, downtown Meridian saw the introduction of the S. H. Kress & Co. building, designed to offer luxury to the general public, alongside the Temple Theater, repurposed as a cinema. Additionally, the federal courthouse was erected in 1933 through a WPA initiative.",
        "Following a slight economic downturn towards the end of the Depression, the nation was thrust into World War II, reigniting the significance of railroads. Railways played a crucial role in ferrying gasoline and recyclable materials for constructing military equipment, leading to Meridian re-emerging as the primary rail hub in the region. This economic revival persisted until the 1950s when private automobiles and the Interstate Highway System overshadowed passenger rail travel. The subsequent decline of the railway sector led to notable job cuts and triggered an outmigration of workers to different regions.",
        "During the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement, Meridian housed a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and various activist groups. Local activist James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, Rita Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and other volunteers aimed to establish a community center to provide classes for African Americans in the region to empower them to vote. The local white population opposed the activism, leading to frequent violent racial conflicts. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman traveled to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had suffered a bombing and arson attack. The trio disappeared on their way back to Meridian that night, and after an extensive FBI probe, their deceased bodies were discovered buried in a dam two months later.",
        "Seven members of the Ku Klux Klan, one of whom was a deputy sheriff, were found guilty of violating the civil rights of the victims in the federal courthouse in Meridian. In a significant moment, a white jury convicted a white official for his involvement in a civil rights-related murder. Following the trial, three individuals were acquitted. Years later, in 2005, the state reopened the case and for the first time pressed charges. Edgar Ray Killen was found guilty of manslaughter and received a 60-year prison sentence. Meridian paid tribute to one of the victims, Chaney, by renaming a section of 49th Avenue in his honor and establishing an annual memorial service.",
        "In the 1960s, with the introduction of highways facilitating commuting, a shift occurred where residents started relocating from downtown to new housing subdivisions in the north. As strip commercial activities moved into downtown, the city took action in the 1970s and 80s by establishing historic districts to safeguard the city's architectural heritage. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was established in 1979, followed by the inception of the Meridian Main Street program in 1985.",
        "Meridian Main Street undertook various initiatives to rejuvenate the downtown area, such as the establishment of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 that mirrored the design of the demolished historic train station from Meridian's Golden Age. Additional endeavors encompassed the refurbishment of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, alongside advocacy for cohesive urban design. In collaboration with The Riley Foundation, Meridian Main Street facilitated the restoration and transformation of the esteemed Grand Opera House in 2006 into the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\"",
        "After the transfer of ownership of Meridian Main Street to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, in collaboration with the Meridian Downtown Association, took the lead in the downtown revitalization project. The Alliance acts as an overarching body, enabling the other groups to utilize its support team and facilities, and concurrently acts as a mediator between them. Initially, there were plans in progress to refurbish the <unk> Building; however, these plans were terminated by the newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry in early 2010. Presently, the Alliance plays a crucial role in fostering further growth and preservation downtown, with a focus on supporting businesses like specialty stores, eateries, and bars to enhance downtown's vibrancy both during the day and night. The Meridian Downtown Association concentrates on enhancing pedestrian activity downtown through the organization of special events, while the Meridian Main Street program is dedicated to bolstering the existing businesses downtown.",
        "Meridian's role as a crucial railroad junction has led to the establishment of numerous hotels to accommodate travelers. Prior to Meridian's prosperous era, notable hotels such as the Great Southern and Grand Avenue hotels were already in place by the late 19th century. The expansion of railroads and the opening of the original Union Station in 1906 further fueled the development of hotels to cater to the increasing number of passengers and workers. The Elmira Hotel was erected in 1905, followed by the construction of the Terminal Hotel in 1910. Hotel Meridian and Union Hotel were also added to the city's hospitality offerings in 1907 and 1908, respectively. Union Hotel gained recognition by being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, while Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were designated as contributing properties within the Meridian Urban Center Historic District.",
        "With the city's expansion, the hotels mirrored the aspirations driven by the flourishing economy, exemplified by the construction of the Lamar Hotel, an eleven-story skyscraper erected in 1927. This historical hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and later repurposed as a county annex building. Recognized as a Mississippi Landmark in 1988, the Lamar Hotel stands as a testament to the city's growth and evolution.",
        "Constructed in 1931, the E.F. Young Hotel stood as a prominent establishment in the African American business sector that emerged towards the western part of the city. It served as a rare accommodation option for African American travelers during the era of segregation, offering a place to stay when few others were available.",
        "During the 1960s and '70s, with the growth of city suburbs, many hotels relocated from downtown. Following the revitalization of the Riley Center in 2006, there has been a surge in the need for a new hotel in the downtown area. Plans for repurposing the <unk> Building for this venture were put forth; however, progress halted due to a shift in city leadership. In response, the <unk> Preservation Society was established in 2013 to promote community engagement and financial backing for the restoration of the building, offering tours of the ground floor and organizing commemorative events.",
        "Meridian boasts nine historical districts that have been officially recognized and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Meridian Downtown Historic District is an amalgamation of the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District. These districts showcase a variety of architectural styles predominantly dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Italianate, Art Deco, Late Victorian, and Bungalow.",
        "The governance structure in Meridian has been the mayor-council or \"strong mayor\" model since 1985. Every four years, the population elects a mayor, while the city council's five members are elected from each of the city's five wards, which are seen as individual districts. The mayor, as the primary executive officer, oversees the daily operations of the city government. On the other hand, the city council acts as the legislative body, establishing policies and approving the city's annual operating budget.",
        "City Hall, situated at 601 23rd Avenue and recognized on the National Register of Historic Places, is overseen by Mayor Percy Bland. The city council comprises Dr. George M. Thomas, representing Ward 1, Kenneth Dustin Markham from Ward 2, Barbara Henson from Ward 3, Kim Houston from Ward 4, and Randy Hammon from Ward 5. Pam McInnis serves as the council clerk, and the city has a workforce totaling 570 employees.",
        "Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the city formed its own Department of Homeland Security (DHS), making it the sole local DHS in the state. Covering a region spanning nine counties, the department received $2.5 million in grants from various entities, including the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. Subsequently, they initiated training programs for law enforcement officers from neighboring Southern states in passenger rail rescue operations. Additionally, the department started offering courses to the public on topics such as basic handgun usage, Boy Scout first aid, hunting, and firearms handling. In times of crises like Hurricane Ivan in September 2005, the DHS played a key role in setting up and supporting shelters for up to 700 evacuees. Presently, the city leads one of the task forces within the Mississippi DHS, which comprises three teams covering nine counties each.",
        "Under the leadership of police chief Lee <unk>, the Meridian Police Department, established in 2009, comprises a total of 115 full-time officers, supplemented by part-time and reserve personnel. In the same year, the department's Criminal Investigations Division handled 4000 cases, with 2000 classified as felonies. Crime rates in 2000 saw a slight increase compared to the previous year, with Meridian being recognized as the safest city in Mississippi for its population exceeding 30,000. The East Mississippi Correctional Facility, managed by the GEO Group on behalf of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, is situated in unincorporated Lauderdale County near Meridian. Overseeing the Meridian Fire Department is Anthony Clayton, who oversaw the response to more than 1600 calls in 2009, comprising 123 structural fires and 609 emergency service requests.",
        "In Mississippi state politics, the city is divided into three sections on the Senate district map. The northern part falls within the 31st State Senate District, represented by Terry Clark Burton (R). A section extending from the southwest to the northeast corner is part of the 32nd State Senate District, represented by Sampson Jackson, II (D). The western and southeastern parts of the city are located in the 33rd State Senate District, held by <unk> Carmichael (R). Regarding the Mississippi House of Representatives districts, the city is split into four districts. The southern and eastern areas belong to House District 81, represented by Steven A. Horne (R). House District 82 covers the city's core and is represented by Wilbert L. Jones (D). Surrounding House District 82 is House District 83, represented by Greg Snowden (R). The western part of the city and a small northern section fall within House District 84, represented by Tad Campbell (R).",
        "On a federal scale, Meridian is situated within the 3rd congressional district of Mississippi, currently overseen by Gregg Harper (R) since 2009. The county of Lauderdale, where Meridian is located, has consistently favored Republican nominees in all presidential elections since 1972. Historically, prior to the transition to the Republican Party, white voters in the region supported Democratic candidates. This trend dates back to the late 1800s when Mississippi predominantly aligned with the Democratic Party as a single-party state.",
        "The city's expansion has mirrored the interplay of various social and economic influences. The population consistently grew in each census following the city's establishment until 1970, with growth rates fluctuating between 165% and as low as 0.2%. However, in the 1970 census, there was a decrease in population, followed by a slight increase by 1980. Subsequently, there was a gradual decline in population, which started to rise again since the early 2000s. Between 1980 and 2000, there was a decline of over 14% in the population. By the 2000 census, the city had a population of 39,968, with a population density of 885.9 inhabitants per square mile (342.0/km2). By 2008, the city ranked as the sixth largest in the state. The population saw an increase by 2010.",
        "Meridian is the main city in the Meridian metropolitan area, comprising three counties – Clarke, Kemper, and Lauderdale – with a total population of 106,139 as of 2009. The city has a population of 232,900 within a 45-mile (72 km) radius and 526,500 within a 65-mile (105 km) radius.",
        "While the city's overall population growth has shown fluctuations over time, there has been a consistent increase in both the number and proportion of residents who are not white. The sole decrease in this demographic occurred between 1960 and 1970, coinciding with a notable decline in the city's total population. According to the 2010 Census data, the city's racial composition was comprised of 61.55% African American, 35.71% White, 0.9% Asian, 0.2% Native American, less than 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.59% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races.

Holm, a tidal island, served as a leper colony until the 18th century, with speculation that some residents were misdiagnosed with leprosy instead of a vitamin deficiency. Maiden Stack gets its name from a 14th-century tale involving Lord Thorvald <unk>, who supposedly built a small house at its summit to protect his daughter from suitors. However, his efforts were in vain as she later left, allegedly pregnant, or in an alternate version, eloped with her fisherman lover. West Voe, featuring the inner area known as '<unk> <unk>', serves as the primary inlet on the north coast, with the smaller <unk> Voe situated just to the west.",
        "The primary village on the island presently is <unk>, situated overlooking <unk> Voe and encircled by inland areas to the east of the hill dyke, extending south from West Voe. Towards the west, a glacial moraine strip divides the island, approximately one and a half kilometers long. The majority of the remaining terrain is characterized by a superficial stony soil, likely originating from glacial deposits. Peat is scarce on the island, and the fertile volcanic soils prevail due to the volcanic rock composition. The absence of peat necessitated the practice of 'turf scalping' for fuel, creating barren rock patches in the island's interior.",
        "Apart from the aforementioned larger islets, there are several other smaller islands and rocky islets scattered along the coastline of Papa Stour. These include unnamed Stack, unnamed Skerry, unnamed Skerry, unnamed Skerry, unnamed Holm, unnamed Stacks, Holm of Melby, Koda Skerry, Lyra Skerry, Skerries of <unk>, Skerry of <unk>, Sula Stack, Swat Skerry, The Horn, unnamed Skerry, and Wilma Skerry. The Ve Skerries are situated 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) northwest, comprising unnamed, North Skerry, unnamed, unnamed, and The Clubb. Positioned between Papa Stour and Ve Skerries is the shallow Papa-<unk> Bank.",
        "Stuart Hill, the sole inhabitant and proprietor of the 1-hectare (2.5 acres) <unk> Holm island, renamed as \"<unk> Island,\" declared the establishment of the Crown Dependency of <unk> on 21 June 2008. Citing a historical marital agreement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland from 1468, Hill contended that the island should be recognized as a British crown dependency, distinct from both the United Kingdom and the European Union. However, the United Kingdom did not acknowledge this assertion.",
        "During the Devonian period, the island was part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent, situated approximately 10 to 25 degrees south of the equator. The geological makeup of the island consists of a diverse range of volcanic and sedimentary rock formations dating back to this period. The Old Red Sandstone deposits, which accumulated between 408 and 370 million years ago, originated from earlier Silurian rocks that were uplifted due to the formation of Pangaea, eroded, and then carried into river deltas. Along the periphery of the eroding mountains, Lake Orcadie, a freshwater body, extended from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. Papa Stour's composition primarily comprises volcanic ashes and lavas from the Devonian era, such as solidified volcanic ash and lava bands (rhyolite), with a notable Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks. Additionally, evidence of Pleistocene glaciation is evident in the presence of numerous large boulders scattered across the island.",
        "The erosion caused by the sea on the soft volcanic rocks has resulted in the formation of a diverse range of geological features including caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, cliffs, voes, and an assortment of other formations, which are considered some of the finest in Britain. One notable cave is the 'Hollow' cave that traverses the north-western tip of the island, extending nearly half a mile with enough width to navigate by rowboat. Additionally, 'Christie's Hole' in the southwest is another impressive cave, a section of which collapsed in 1981. Also noteworthy is 'Francie's Hole' near Voe in the west, which was favored by John Tudor, who, in his Victorian memoirs, described it as...",
        "Otters, grey seals, killer whales, and harbor porpoises are commonly observed in the vicinity of Papa Stour. The island is home to breeding populations of Atlantic puffins, Arctic and common terns, kittiwakes, Arctic skuas, northern fulmars, common guillemots, razorbills, curlews, wheatears, ringed plovers, and great black-backed gulls. Additionally, several migratory species have been documented in the area.",
        "A variety of native wildflowers like mountain everlasting, spring squill, and <unk> flourish alongside the common heather on the island. The western part of the island holds significance as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, while the surrounding waters of Papa Stour are designated as a Special Area of Conservation. Moreover, the traditional Shetland Pony continues to be bred on the island.",
        "The island was initially settled around 3000 BC, featuring Neolithic burial chambers called 'heel-shaped cairns.' Limited information is available about the pre-Celtic and Celtic periods, but it is believed that upon the arrival of the Norse, they encountered a religious community. The island's name, derived from the Norse words for \"Big island of the Papar\" (Celtic monks), differentiates it from Papa Little, located approximately 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) to the west.",
        "Papa Stour is the focus of a 1299 Old Norse manuscript, the oldest extant document from Shetland, detailing a significant event at Duke Hakon Magnusson's residence before he ascended to the throne as King Hakon V of Norway. Close to <unk> Voe lies a circle of stones marking the site of a 'ting' assembly where a duel took place, won by Lord Thorvald <unk> who was later known as ‘dominus de <unk>’ after being accused of corruption in the same 1299 record. The narrative also alludes to the tragic story of his daughter. The ruins of Duke Hakon's 13th-century dwelling can still be seen near <unk> Voe.",
        "In 1469, nominal Scottish control was established over Shetland, although the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' retained their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. During the 16th century, merchants from Bremen and Hamburg set up a seasonal trading post to purchase fish from the local fleet. By the 18th century, the island was owned by two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick. They oversaw a thriving fishery industry known as 'deep sea,' which was carried out in the summer months using six-oared boats called 'böds.'",
        "Established in 1806, the island church stands above Kirk Sand in the Fore Wick bay. Around 300 meters away from the current church location, there might exist an older chapel site known as the 'Kirkyard' or 'Kirk'. Positioned on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay, this location is identified by the Ordnance Survey as the \"site of a medieval chapel from the twelfth century.\" Legend has it that supernatural forces disrupted the construction of the chapel, causing each day's progress to be undone at night. Eventually, the cornerstone mysteriously shifted to the present church site, where construction resumed successfully. Although excavations in 2004 yielded minimal findings, such as rhyolite blocks and a whalebone rib, they provided some validity to the folklore surrounding the site.",
        "During the 19th century, the fishing station at West Voe on the island was established, with a population exceeding 360 residents. Nevertheless, a combination of fuel scarcities and a downturn in fishing activities following the advent of steam drifters resulted in a decrease in population from the 1870s onwards. During this period, another significant event unfolded on Papa Stour as Edwin Lindsay, a military officer in the Indian army and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was deemed mentally unstable and exiled to the island as punishment for refusing to partake in a duel. He endured 26 years of captivity until his release in 1835, orchestrated by the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson. Lindsay's Well, located in the southern part of the island, served as the spring where he was permitted to bathe.",
        "In Dutch Loch, there are well-preserved examples of horizontal water mills, also referred to as Norse or Clack Mills. Initially designed as two-story structures with sod roofs, these mills were integrated into hillsides to allow access to the upper level where the millstone was positioned. These mills housed a stationary lower millstone and a rotating upper millstone powered by water cascading onto the paddles beneath. Some of these mills were operational on Papa Stour in the early 1900s, and a functional Norse mill can still be found on the Burn of <unk> in the southern Mainland of Shetland.",
        "Similar to various small Scottish islands, Papa Stour also saw its population peak in the 19th century, followed by a substantial decrease over the years, as seen on Mingulay. By 1970, the island's school had shut down, and the population had dwindled to only sixteen elderly inhabitants. However, a turning point came when an ad in Exchange and Mart offered a croft and five sheep at no cost to newcomers, leading to a surge in applicants. This initiative resulted in a population of 33 by 1981. Nonetheless, by 2005, discord among residents resulted in legal disputes, causing a decline to 20 inhabitants, with some leaving the island and the school closing. The population further dropped to nine by early 2008 after a family of seven departed. The 2011 census reported a resident population of 15; however, during the period 2011-11, the collective population of Scottish islands increased by 4% to reach 103,702.",
        "The Aberdeen fishing vessel Ben Doran sank on the Ve Skerries, located 3 miles northwest of Papa Stour, on the evening of 28 March 1930 while en route to Scalloway to unload its catch. Although the weather was relatively favorable when the vessel ran aground, another fishing boat spotted the wreckage the next day. Despite efforts by the coastguard and local volunteers to rescue the crew (as there was no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), worsening weather prevented them from reaching the skerries. A late request for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, just 120 miles away, was futile. Unfortunately, all 9 crew members lost their lives in the incident. Only the bodies of James Mitchell, returned to Aberdeen, and those of J. Cormack and J.R. <unk>, laid to rest in Scalloway, were recovered.",
        "In February 1940, the cargo vessel SS Highcliffe got stranded in fog on <unk> Holm. Fortunately, the weather was favorable, and only the ship and its cargo were damaged. Fast forward to 1967, the Aberdeen trawler Juniper also ran aground in Lyra Sound near 60 meters (200 feet) cliffs. A team of 12 sailors was saved by the <unk> lifeboat, with the coxswain receiving the RNLI silver medal for the heroic rescue operation.",
        "The most recent shipwreck at Papa Stour occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking, under the command of skipper Alec Flett, sank at the Ve Skerries. Despite efforts by the local lifeboat being hindered by rough sea conditions, a British Airways Sikorsky helicopter was dispatched from Sumburgh Airport upon the request of Coastguard Station Officer Alec Webster in Lerwick. The helicopter successfully rescued the entire crew of the vessel, showcasing remarkable bravery in the face of stormy weather. This incident, which fortunately resulted in no casualties, led to the construction of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979 and played a pivotal role in the establishment of the current Search and Rescue helicopter unit headquartered at Sumburgh Airport.",
        "Crofting is the cornerstone of life on the island. While sheep play a vital role in the agricultural economy, a variety of other livestock such as cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, and geese are also raised. Additionally, there is cultivation of vegetables within enclosed circular walls referred to as 'kailyards'. Fishing remains a part of the economy, albeit on a small scale. The island has a post office at the pier, but lacks a shop. The introduction of mains electricity to the island occurred towards the end of the twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project, a Christian-backed housing initiative, provides lodging for men dealing with substance abuse problems. Ferries now operate between the island and West Burra in the Shetland Mainland, with the journey lasting 45 minutes. Despite the ferry's capability to transport cars, there is only a single short road on the island. For visiting yachts, the four main voes offer good shelter, yet navigating the strong tides in the Sound of Papa and to the northwest demands caution.",
        "It is also the father figure in <unk>'s poem \"Da Sang o da Papa men,\" which has been embraced into the folk song repertoire, with music composed by <unk> Manson. The repeated chorus refrain, \" <unk> Foula Doon!,\" is especially memorable.",
        "\"<unk> Foula <unk>!\" describes the traditional practice of fishermen venturing far out to sea in their fishing boat until the towering cliffs of Foula disappeared from view, typically reaching a distance of approximately 96 kilometers (60 miles) west of Papa Stour. The term 'tide @-@ lumps' denotes the enlarged swells caused by the wind opposing the tide. The piece concludes with a poignant image of the fishermen guided back home to Papa by the fragrance of home carried over the water, showcasing <unk>'s talent in evoking vivid sensory experiences. Furthermore, the poem gains additional depth as it pays homage to the collapsed Da Horn o Papa, a significant geographical landmark, emphasizing the poem's tribute not only to a bygone way of life but also to a notable natural feature.",
        "\"Angel of Death\" is the first song on Slayer's 1986 album Reign in Blood, composed by the band's guitarist Jeff Hanneman. The lyrics and music draw inspiration from the actions of Josef Mengele, a Nazi doctor notorious for his human experiments at Auschwitz during World War II. The song triggered allegations of Nazi sympathies and racism against Slayer over the years.",
        "Despite the debate surrounding the track and its connection to the postponement of Reign in Blood's release, \"Angel of Death\" is included in all of Slayer's live albums and DVDs and has been featured in various films. Critics praised the song, with Steve Huey from AllMusic labeling it a \"classic.\"",
        "During a tour with the band, Slayer's guitarist Jeff Hanneman composed the song \"Angel of Death\" after immersing himself in books about Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Hanneman recalled purchasing two books on Mengele during a stop, finding the subject matter deeply disturbing. He explained that when it was time to work on the record, the vivid details from the books inspired the lyrics for \"Angel of Death.\"",
        "The song's lyrics describe Mengele's medical procedures on inmates at the Auschwitz camp in World War II, focusing on groups like dwarfs and twins. These experiments, mentioned in \"Angel of Death,\" encompassed a range of physical and mental assessments. They involved surgeries without pain relief, blood transfusions among twins, endurance trials, gas chambers, injections of deadly pathogens, gender reassignment surgeries, organ and limb removals, and other brutal practices.",
        "The line \" <unk> together, joining heads. Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart,\" found in the penultimate verse, alludes to the accusation that Mengele surgically connected twins, one of whom was deformed. According to Auschwitz survivor Vera Alexander's testimony during the 1961 trial of SS officer Adolf Eichmann, it was claimed that Mengele sewed the hunchbacked child to the other twin, binding their wrists together as well. This assertion gained prominence after Alexander appeared in the 1985 documentary The Search for Mengele, referenced by various writers, including Mengele expert Gerald Posner.",
        "The lyrical themes and artwork of \"Angel of Death\" caused a postponement in the release of Slayer's 1986 album Reign in Blood. The band was under Def Jam Records, but its distributor, Columbia Records, declined to release the album because they found the content too graphic. Eventually, Geffen Records distributed Reign in Blood on October 7, 1986, although the controversy surrounding it led to the album not being included in Geffen Records' official release schedule."
