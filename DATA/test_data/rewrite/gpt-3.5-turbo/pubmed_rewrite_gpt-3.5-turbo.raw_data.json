From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.",
        "Question: Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord arteries a waste of time? Answer: With monitoring of MEP and SSEP, sacrifice--without reimplantation--of as many as 15 intercostal and lumbar arteries during TAA/A repair is safe, resulting in acceptably low rates of immediate and delayed paraplegia. This experience suggests that routine surgical implantation of segmental vessels is",
        "Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample generalize? Answer: Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.",
        "Question: Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events cause myocardial ischaemic events?

        "Question: Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? Answer: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. Prospective studies should examine this",
        "Question: Does preoperative anemia adversely affect colon and rectal surgery outcomes? Answer: This large multicenter database analysis suggests that the presence of severe and moderate and even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for complications and a longer hospital stay after colon surgery.",
