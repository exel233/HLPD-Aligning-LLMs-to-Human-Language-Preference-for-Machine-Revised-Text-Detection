        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",

This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",

In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain\u2019s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol.

        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study.

        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful.

The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang.

Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity.

In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the Theodosian Code\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the Corpus Juris Civilis.

        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C.

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",

Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them.

In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carr\u00e9 ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carr\u00e9 system, the various corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",

According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\".

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",

Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.

        "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's",

In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988.

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\".

Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.

The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \"Jump\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks.

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).",

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent\u2013child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",

Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China.

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are quite diverse. The far north is occupied by the Harz mountains, followed by the Goldene Aue, a fertile floodplain around Nordhausen with the Helme as most important river. The north-west includes the Eichsfeld, a hilly and sometimes forested region, where the Leine river emanates. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the 3000 km\u00b2 wide Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river and completely surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\u00fcn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\u00fccke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\u00f6rselberge and Hainich.

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa.

General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated.

        "Like reptiles, birds primarily excrete nitrogenous waste from their bloodstreams as uric acid, rather than urea or ammonia. They lack a urinary bladder and external urethral opening, and uric acid is usually excreted with feces in a semisolid form. However, some birds, such as hummingbirds, can excrete nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, while others, like mammals, excrete creatinine instead of creatine. The material, as well as the output of the intestines, is expelled through the cloaca, a multi-purpose opening that serves as a waste outlet, a mating point, and an egg-laying site. Many bird species regurgitate pellets, and males within certain families, like the Palaeognathae, do not use the cloaca for mating.",
        "Mammalian fur, commonly known as pelage, can exhibit a wide range of colors among different populations, within a population, and on individual animals. It is not uncommon to find light to dark color variations in mammals. While age may sometimes be the factor responsible for these color changes, in other cases, other factors come into play. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often contribute to the variations in mammalian coloration. These selective forces typically favor certain colors to enhance an animal's chances of survival. Camouflage is generally considered the primary driving force behind color variation in mammals, although research suggests that factors such as sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may also influence the development of fur colors. Camouflage is the most prominent mechanism for color variation, as it allows animals to blend in with their surroundings, making it more difficult for predators to spot them.",
        "In Israel, education is highly valued within the national culture, with historical roots dating back to Ancient Israel. Israeli culture views higher education as a key factor in achieving higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. This emphasis on education has its roots in the Jewish diaspora, from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement to the origins of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were among the first to introduce compulsory education, with the organized community taking responsibility for educating the next generation of Jews. This culture of valuing education is reflected in contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis on scholarship, learning, and the promotion of intellectual pursuits. Additionally, Israel's high university educational attainment rate further exemplifies the importance of higher education in Israeli society. The Israeli education system has been praised for its commitment to providing high-quality education to its citizens.",

        "Following the fall of the Wu and the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265-420), many elite Chinese families collaborated with non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some lost their social privileges and fled to areas south of the Yangtze River. Some of these Chinese refugees from the north may have settled near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181-234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from the Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together in the suburbs of Hangzhou and formed an exclusive, closed village called Zhuge Village, consisting of villagers all with the family name \"Zhuge.\" The village has intentionally isolated itself from surrounding communities for centuries, and it only recently gained public recognition. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain may have taken refuge in this exclusive village.",
        "The '98 season began with a somber note, as legendary broadcaster Harry Caray passed away. The Cubs had to fill the void left by the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston. To help protect Sammy Sosa in the lineup, they signed Henry Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"H-Rod,\" who slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season with the team. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career-high 19 wins, and Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen. Mark Grace had one of his best seasons. The Cubs were in the spotlight in 1998, with Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood as their biggest headliners. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, tying the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His impressive strikeout numbers earned him the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month.",

Although some risks, such as emotional distress from fear of abuse or exploitation, and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, other risks like teenage pregnancy through contraceptive failure are often viewed as social issues in many Western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers contracts an STI. In the United States, adolescents tend to engage in non-intercourse sexual activities, mistakenly believing that this reduces the risk of STIs. Clinicians report an increasing number of cases of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and it is estimated that 15% of adults in the country have HPV.",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, various vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) have developed and evolved independently in different regions and ethnicities. Before the 19th century, these languages were collectively referred to as \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, and later popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades. It was officially referred to as \"Serbo-Croat\", \"Croato-Serbian\", \"Serbian and Croatian\", \"Croatian and Serbian\", \"Serbian or Croatian\", \"Croatian or Serbian\", and \"Serbian or Croatian\" in different variations. However, unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically referred to the language as \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\" without implying any distinction between the two. In independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered as three names for a single language.",

This typically begins in the adolescent years and involves trying on different behaviors, appearances, and identities to discover who they are. However, maintaining an identity in this stage can be challenging due to various factors such as family life, environment, and social status. While it is often referred to as identity development, empirical studies suggest that the process can be more accurately described as identity development, confirming that it involves both changes in content and structure.",

The dominant Greek population in the cities, which included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia, and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates, retained traditional Greek city-state institutions such as assemblies, councils, and elected magistrates. However, these institutions were merely a facade, as they were always under the control of the royal Seleucid officials. In addition to these cities, there were numerous Seleucid garrisons, military colonies, and Greek villages established throughout the empire to ensure the establishment of their rule. This population of 'Greco-Macedonians' was essential to the Seleucid Empire's political and military power.",
        "The implications are numerous as various research traditions are currently heavily using the lens of identity to examine various phenomena. One implication of identity and identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasingly challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) stated that individuals tend to gravitate towards or avoid certain jobs to a certain extent based on how much they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway, 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or praises. In her analysis, Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake off the stigma of being \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway, 2005). The process by which people arrive at justifications for and values for various occupational choices is also examined. Among these factors are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott, 2006, p. 33). Individuals in these types of jobs may experience various emotions and attitudes towards their work.",
        "Emotions play a significant role in social interactions and relationships, and as a result, are intricately connected to basic physiology, especially the stress systems. This connection is crucial because emotions are linked to the anti-stress complex, which involves an oxytocin-attachment system that plays a critical role in bonding. Emotional traits, such as temperaments, can affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems, as observed in various species and taxa. These characteristics are passed down through generations due to the influence of genes, which are encoded in DNA sequences and serve as a blueprint for assembling proteins that make up cells.",
        "Stanley Schachter's theory was based on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and then asked them how they felt. Surprisingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n discovered that most of these patients felt something, but in the absence of a stimulus that would evoke an emotion, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an emotional experience. Schachter agreed that physiological reactions play a significant role in emotions. He suggested that these reactions contribute to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a particular, emotionally arousing event, and that this appraisal is what defines the subjective emotional experience. Consequently, emotions are the result of a two-stage process: general physiological arousal and the subsequent experience of the emotion. For instance, the physiological arousal of a pounding heart can occur in response to an emotionally evocative stimulus, such as a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political unrest continued. John decided to form an alliance with King Philip II of France, who had just returned from the crusade. John wanted to acquire Normandy, Anjou, and other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for joining forces with Philip. However, John's mother persuaded him not to pursue an alliance. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, returned and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened and agreed to support Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as the heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to claim that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. In fact, Richard had been captured by the Duke of Austria and handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John took advantage of this situation and made plans to take control of the English throne.",
        "During the Early Modern period, universities continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages, covering subjects such as natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, law, and grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was widely studied, and medicine also relied on the works of Galen and Arabic scholarship. The humanist movement played a significant role in transforming this state-of-affairs. When humanist professors joined the faculty, they introduced the studia humanitatis, focusing on students' abilities to communicate effectively, translate and interpret classical texts, and lead honorable lives. The humanist approach to learning and expertise in ancient texts influenced other scholars within the university, promoting the ultimate importance of these texts. Professors of medicine, such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop, were often taught from a humanist perspective.",

In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood proposed declaring independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not implemented. The American Civil War (1861-1865) military conscription laws, which spared wealthier men who could pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, which involved ethnic Irish working class. The situation in the city deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property, after a decade-long competition between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. During the Draft Riots, rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to the efforts of the institution's staff.",
        "But during the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological usage of the term emerged. In 1765, an anonymous author in a French Enlightenment periodical discussed \"The general love of humanity... a virtue previously unrecognized among us, and which we will courageously call 'humanism', as the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary idea.\" During the latter half of the 18th and early 19th centuries, many grassroots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies emerged dedicated to human betterment and the spread of knowledge, with both Christian and non-Christian affiliations. Following the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be developed solely through human reason, independent of traditional religious institutions, was attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophers such as Rousseau. This viewpoint was met with strong opposition.",
        "The outcome was a series of creative yet unpopular financial actions. During his seventeen-year reign, King John imposed scutage payments eleven times, compared to eleven times in total throughout the rule of the three preceding monarchs. In numerous instances, these taxes were imposed even when there were no actual military campaigns. This went against the original concept of scutage as an alternative to actual military service. John maximized his ability to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging exorbitant sums beyond barons' financial capabilities. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents recovering their investments through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, the increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "During the Enlightenment, various novel concepts concerning religion emerged, including Deism and discussions of atheism. Deism, as described by Thomas Paine, involves a simple belief in God as the Creator, without reference to the Bible or any other supernatural sources. Instead, a Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide their beliefs, a perspective that was widely appreciated by many thinkers of the time.\n\nAtheism was a topic of frequent debate, although there were few vocal proponents. Wilson and Reill emphasize that, \"in fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they criticized Christianity, were true atheists. Instead, they were critics of orthodox beliefs, leaning towards skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some adhered to Pierre Bayle's position, arguing that atheists could still maintain a strong moral compass. However, many others, such as Voltaire, held that the absence of a belief in a God who punishes evil undermined the moral order of society. That is, since atheists did not submit to any Supreme Authority, no law, and had no fear of any repercussions, the moral fabric of society was weakened.",
        "Sleep does not affect memory acquisition or recall when a person is awake. This indicates that sleep plays a significant role in memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain strengthens neural connections, which enhances the brain's ability to stabilize and retain memories. Numerous studies have shown that sleep improves memory retention by promoting active consolidation of memories. System consolidation occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), during which memories are reactivated, but not all memories are enhanced. Additionally, qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to the long-term store during sleep. When you sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, which then reviews and processes the memories, moving them into long-term memory. If you don't get enough sleep, it can be more difficult to learn, as these neural connections are not as strong, leading to lower memory retention.",
        "Despite the common belief that memory functions as a recording device, this is not the case. The molecular processes that underlie memory formation and maintenance are highly dynamic and encompass multiple stages that span over time windows ranging from mere seconds to an entire lifetime. In fact, research has shown that our memories are not fixed but rather are constructed. This process occurs during both memory encoding and recall. For example, consider a study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer in 1974, in which participants were asked to watch a traffic accident video and then provide information about it. Those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" reported higher speeds than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Additionally, those participants who were asked about broken glass a week later were twice as likely to report having seen it, even though it was not actually present in the video.",
        "During the second millennium BC, the region of modern Zhejiang existed outside the major cultural sphere of influence of the Shang civilization. Instead, this area was inhabited by various tribal groups collectively referred to as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue first emerged in historical records during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to these records, the kingdom of Yue was located in the northern part of Zhejiang. Shiji asserts that the leaders of the kingdom of Yue were descendants of the Shang founder, Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that the culture and history of both the kingdom of Yue and the Baiyue were distinct from those of other kingdoms in north and central China. These cultures and histories were meticulously recorded in historical records during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Qin dynasty.",
        "Protestantism also extended from German territories to France, where the Protestant believers were referred to as Huguenots. Calvin remained interested in French religious affairs from his base in Geneva, regularly training pastors to lead congregations there. Despite the heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress throughout the nation, appealing to people who were alienated by the stubbornness and complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism acquired a distinctly political character, becoming more evident with the conversions of nobles in the 1550s. This set the stage for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained momentum with the unexpected death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became defining characteristics of the time, reaching their peak during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre on August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party massacred between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France.",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League (NFL) preseason has a well-structured format. Each team competes in four pre-season exhibition games annually, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams who partake in an additional game, known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition matches generally take place in August and serve the purpose of assisting coaches in reducing the offseason roster size from 90 players to the 53 players permitted during the regular season. While the scheduling formula for preseason games is more flexible compared to the regular season, there are still certain limitations and traditions that dictate the selection of preseason opponents. Teams are also restricted in terms of the days and times when they can play these games. Similar to practices observed in baseball and hockey, split-squad matches are sometimes employed by NFL teams, where a single squad is divided to play two games on the same day.",
        "During the early and mid-1980s, Libya faced economic difficulties, with their annual oil revenue decreasing from $21 billion in 1982 to $5.4 billion in 1986. In response, the government focused on irrigation projects, starting construction on the Great Man-Made River in 1983, designed to be completed by the end of the decade, but remained incomplete by the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were reduced. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in Chad, which led to their re-invasion of Chad in December 1980, and their continued involvement in the civil war. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected Gaddafi's suggestion of a political merger, and called for a Libyan withdrawal. This withdrawal occurred in November 1981, but the civil war continued, leading Libya to send troops back into Chad and clashing with French forces supporting southern Chadian forces.",

Intended torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun boycotted the event to protest against the Chinese government's crackdown in Tibet. More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to protect the 24-kilometer route, which began at the Olympic Park, which was constructed when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees. He poured gasoline on himself but police quickly surrounded him and carried him away. Two other demonstrators tried to stop the torch but failed. Fighting broke out near the beginning of the relay between a group of 500 Chinese supporters and approximately the same number of protesters.",
        "The conceptions of separation of powers, held by Jefferson and James Madison, have long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, as President, did not issue any Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress, but did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. On the other hand, Madison issued four religious proclamations as President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds that they violated the first amendment. Both Jefferson and Madison also attended religious services at the Capitol. In his writings before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison argued, \"If Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote about \"total separation of the church from the state.\" He emphasized the strong separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States and described the practical distinction between religion and civil government.",
        "The works of Virgil have left a significant impact on Latin poetry, changing the landscape of the genre almost immediately upon their release. The Eclogues, Georgics, and especially the Aeneid became essential texts in school curricula, familiarized to all educated Romans. Poets following in Virgil's footsteps often reference his works to generate meaning in their own poems. Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1, and his summary of Aeneas' story in Book 14 of Metamorphoses, known as the \"mini-Aeneid,\" has been considered a significant example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile, is considered an anti-Virgilian work, deviating from Virgil's focus on divine mechanisms and historical events. Flavian poet Statius, in his 12-book epic Thebaid, closely engages with Virgil's poetry, advising his work to \"follow afar and ever venerate the footsteps\" of the divine Aeneid. In Silius Italicus, Virgil's influence is evident as well.",
        "Terry Eastland, the author of \"Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" claims that most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland believes that the founding fathers of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would be enjoyed by those who did not need it, primarily middle-class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a high-risk strategy that sometimes fails to deliver benefits, and that without it, individuals would have more freedom to compete with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his book \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\" has identified negative consequences of affirmative action. Sowell claims that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to claim membership in preferred groups (i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action) in order to enjoy the benefits.",
        "During this era, the United States' largest military engagement was the War of 1812, which took place as Britain was fighting against France in a major war. In an attempt to block American shipments to France, Britain adopted a policy of trade restrictions and impressed American sailors into the Royal Navy, despite protests. To further hinder American expansion, Britain also supported an Indian uprising in the American Midwest. Ultimately, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, marking the first time the nation had officially declared war. However, the U.S. was not confident in its ability to defeat the Royal Navy and instead chose to invade British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as leverage in negotiations. While the invasion of Canada was a failure, the United States had some success in concurrent wars against Native Americans, such as Tecumseh's War and the Creek War. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade the United States, but the conflict was ultimately resolved through the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war in 1815.",
        "Regarding the outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor serving as the Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism, and protector of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed following the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan uprising in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and declared himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court dispatched forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and reconquered Xinjiang. Subsequently, the political system of China proper was formally implemented in Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which became a vassal of the Qing empire after helping to defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status when Xinjiang became a province up until 1930. In early 20th century, Britain sent an expeditionary force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to",
        "Brigham Young University, or BYU, boasts 21 NCAA varsity teams. Of these, 19 teams have primarily competed in the Mountain West Conference since its inception in 1999 until the school left in 2011. Prior to this time, BYU teams participated in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are known as the \"Cougars,\" and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Due to the fact that many of its players serve full-time missions for two years (men at 18, women at 19), BYU athletes tend to be older on average compared to those from other schools. The NCAA permits students to serve missions for two years without deducting this time from their eligibility period. Although this has sparked minor controversy, it is generally agreed that it does not provide the school with any significant advantage, as players receive no athletic or physical training during their missions. BYU has also garnered attention from sports networks for its refusal to play games on certain days, such as Sundays.",
        "John considered the interdict as a direct challenge to his authority. He responded by attempting to hold Innocent personally accountable and to create division between the English clergy who might support him and those who allied themselves with the Roman authorities. John seized the lands of clergy who refused to conduct services or those linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the concubines of some clerics during this time, only releasing them after fines were paid. He also seized the lands of English church members who had fled the country, and he promised protection to clergy who remained loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209, the situation had yet to be resolved, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not accept Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent issued the excommunication.",
        "In Mainland China, Japanese divisions 3rd, 6th, and 40th gathered at Yueyang and advanced south in three columns, crossing the Xinqiang River and attempting to cross the Miluo River to reach Changsha. In January 1942, Chinese forces gained a victory at Changsha, marking the first Allied success against Japan. Following the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army executed a sweeping campaign through Zhejiang and Jiangxi, known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, targeting American airmen and Chinese allies while destroying air bases. This operation began on May 15 with 40 infantry battalions and 15-16 artillery battalions but was repelled by Chinese forces by September, leaving behind a path of destruction.",
        "A tech media website, CNET, has awarded the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 with a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, stating that it is \"Excellent\". The Super Slim console packs a powerful gaming machine into a smaller package, while maintaining its gaming library and streaming services. However, the reviewer criticized the design as being cheap, pointing out that the disc loader can be frustrating to use. They also mentioned that the absence of an autoloading disc tray makes the console feel cheap compared to the previous models. Additionally, the cheapest Super Slim model is still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and the upgraded hard drive can be easily replaced in a Slim model. Overall, the reviewer feels that the smaller size and bigger hard drive should not be considered an upgrade due to the absence of key features.",
        "In July 1645, Dorgon issued a controversial edict, which required adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and wear the queue hairstyle, a Manchu tradition. Those who did not comply faced death. This edict was popularized as, \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" The Manchus saw this policy as a test of loyalty, while the Han Chinese perceived it as a humiliating reminder of Qing authority and a challenge to their traditional Confucian values, as per the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing), which states that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" During the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but wore it in long strands.",
        "Boundaries can be viewed as inclusive or exclusive, depending on how they are perceived by others. For example, an exclusive boundary is established when a person sets rules for the behavior of others. In contrast, an inclusive boundary is created through the use of a marker that others are comfortable associating with. However, this inclusive boundary may also impose restrictions on the individuals it encompasses by limiting their interaction with other boundaries. For instance, a newcomer who speaks a particular language in a room full of people speaking various languages may be understood by some but not others. Those who do not understand the language may perceive it as an exclusive boundary, indicating that they are excluded from the newcomer's group.",
        "Various manufacturers introduced flexible, or so-called \"unbreakable,\" records made of unusual materials during the 78 rpm era. In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles, and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the original material, were introduced during this time.",
        "In 1919, following the Treaty of Versailles, Strasbourg was restituted to France in accordance with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points,\" without a referendum. The date of the transfer was set retroactively to Armistice Day. It is uncertain whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have favored France, as the political parties seeking an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France only accounted for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag and local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro-French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement began with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les d\u00e9put\u00e9s protestataires,\" and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German parliament.",
        "As the Western European kingdoms were established, the Eastern Roman Empire remained strong and experienced an economic revival that lasted until the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions in the eastern part of the empire, most of them occurring in the Balkans. A peace with Persia, a long-time enemy of Rome, lasted throughout much of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire featured closer ties between the political state and the Christian Church, with religious matters becoming increasingly important in eastern politics compared to Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law, with the first effort, the Theodosian Code, completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place, the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led Justinian's reign to focus on defensive measures.",
        "When Nintendo introduced its NES console in the United States, the design was purposely different from those of other gaming systems. The company aimed to distinguish its product from competitors and to avoid the generally negative image that gaming consoles had acquired following the video game crash in 1983. One outcome of this strategy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, which was designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean, and the pins on the connector were new. However, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When users inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge's ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out over the years and the ZIF connector eventually malfunctioned.",
        "Protestants played a key role in advocating for religious freedom. The issue of freedom of conscience held a high priority on theological, philosophical, and political agendas due to the refusal of Martin Luther to recant his beliefs at the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Worms (1521). Luther believed that faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and thus could not be forced upon a person. Persecuted groups such as the Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practiced separation of church and state. In the early 17th century, Baptist leaders like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their ideas influenced the stances of figures like John Milton and John Locke on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights all recognize the importance of religious freedom and the right to practice one's faith.",
        "Birds possess a highly efficient method of supplying oxygen to their blood, with a tenfold greater surface area for gas exchange than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries for every unit of lung volume compared to mammals. The arteries are made up of thick, elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of ventricular constriction and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood flows through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and enters arterioles, which function as a transportation system to distribute oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues, they further divide to increase surface area and slow blood flow. The blood then moves into capillaries, where gas exchange can take place. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, facilitating efficient gas exchange and nutrient delivery.",

Former player Austin Carr holds the tournament's record for scoring the most points, with 61, in a single game. Although they have not won the NCAA Tournament, they were named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation twice. The team has managed to upset number one ranked teams multiple times, most notably ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. They have beaten eight additional number-one teams, making their total of nine wins the second-highest in history against the top team, with 10 wins overall.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621 by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys\" states that asphaltum was discovered in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel, and proposed to use it in a variety of ways, mainly in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth.",

It was the leading department store on State Street, the main shopping street in the Midwest, attracting upscale customers who traveled by train from the surrounding region. They also patronized nearby hotels. The company eventually grew to become a major chain before being renamed Macy's on September 9, 2006. Marshall Field's was known for its exceptional customer service, as well as its iconic Frango mints, which were first introduced by Frederick & Nelson Department Store. The store also had many firsts, such as the first European buying office and the first bridal registry. Additionally, Marshall Field's was the first to offer a personal shopping service, which was provided for free in all its stores until the end of the chain.",
        "Some streetcars used a third-rail to collect current. The third rail was at street level. The tram picked up the current through a plow accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, many former streetcar systems in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) and Manhattan operated in this way to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. Similar to London's abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway, the evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood.",
        "According to the 2010 Census, Asian Americans in New York City numbered more than one million, surpassing the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. As the most populous U.S. city, New York contains the highest total Asian population. The borough of Queens is home to the largest Asian American population in the state, as well as the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States. It also boasts the highest degree of ethnic diversity among urban areas worldwide.\n\nThe Chinese population is the fastest-growing nationality in New York State, and multiple satellite Chinatowns have emerged in Brooklyn and around Flushing, Queens. These traditional urban enclaves are thriving while also rapidly expanding into suburban Nassau County on Long Island. As a result, New York City and the surrounding area have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, with large-scale Chinese immigration continuing into the city and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City's population was Chinese.",
        "In their 2003 paper, \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\", Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles provide a detailed critique of the application of FST to human populations. They argue that the commonly cited figure of 85% is misleading as it suggests that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. However, they claim that this figure does not accurately reflect human population history, as it treats all human groups as independent from one another. To better understand the relationships between human groups, it is important to recognize that some groups are the ancestors of others, making them paraphyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. For example, under the recent African origin theory, the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups, as it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive. However, this figure of 85% is overly simplified and does not consider the complex relationships between human populations.",
        "In recent years, Libya's economy has undergone significant changes with an increased focus on privatization. While the government has rejected the idea of nationalized industries advocated in The Green Book, they have described their approach as \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. This shift in policy has been welcomed by the government and has led to widespread privatization, with the oil industry being sold to private corporations in 2003 and $40 billion of direct foreign investment by 2004. However, some sectors of the population have expressed opposition to these changes through public demonstrations. Despite this, the pace of change has not been completely halted, and in 2010, plans were announced to further privatize half of the Libyan economy over the next decade. While these changes have occurred, there has not been an accompanying political liberalization, with the government retaining control. In 2010, the government also delegated further powers to municipal councils.",
        "The initial military exercises began in September 1806. A notable letter to Marshal Soult described the plan for the campaign, in which Napoleon outlined the main characteristics of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase \"square battalion\" (le bataillon-carr\u00e9). According to this system, the various divisions of the Grande Arm\u00e9e would march together in close proximity to provide timely support to each other. If one division was attacked, the others could quickly mobilize and come to its aid. Napoleon led 180,000 troops to invade Prussia, rapidly advancing to the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, he sought to eliminate one opponent before the arrival of reinforcements could tip the balance of the war. Following the discovery of the Prussian army's position, the French army pivoted towards the west and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. The twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt took place on October 14th, and the French army decisively won the battles.",
        "Regarding the timing of Germany's rapprochement, many historians believe that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, who was Jewish and unpopular with Nazi Germany, eliminated a barrier to negotiations. Stalin immediately ordered Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Litvinov's previous attempts to form an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western stance, indicated that his dismissal signaled a possible Soviet rapprochement with Germany. Similarly, Molotov's appointment sent a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to negotiations. The dismissal also indicated to France and Britain that a potential negotiation option with Germany existed. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance meant the loss of an admirable technician, while Molotov's approach was seen as \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",
        "Critics labeled Gaddafi as despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain, and foolish. Western governments and media portrayed him as a vicious ruler of an oppressed people. During the Reagan administration, the United States considered him Public Enemy No. 1 and Reagan famously called him the \"mad dog of the Middle East.\" According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's rule, due to his government's extensive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described as a police state by western commentators. Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses, with organizations such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others reporting that hundreds of arrested political opponents often did not receive fair trials and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial executions, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996, according to HRW estimates.",
        "A true predator is known for capturing and consuming other living beings. Unlike other types of predators, which cause harm to their prey in some way, true predators kill them. Predators can either actively hunt for prey or wait and ambush their prey, as in the case of ambush predators. Some predators may kill large prey and dismember or chew it before eating it, such as jaguars or humans. Others may swallow their smaller prey whole, like bottlenose dolphins eating fish or snakes, ducks, or storks swallowing frogs. Some predators, like domestic cats and dogs, may do either depending on the situation; they would consume a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation involves venom that subdues prey before the predator consumes it, as in the case of venomous snakes.",
        "The Israelites experienced political independence twice in ancient history, first during the times of the Biblical judges and then in the United Monarchy. Following the fall of the United Monarchy, the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term \"Jew\" originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and referred to someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift in the ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (referring to residents of Judah) was not found in the Torah, but is explicitly mentioned in the Book of Esther, which was written in the 4th century BCE and is part of the Jewish Tanakh.\n\nIn 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, the King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining citizens were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed Jewish exiles to return to Judah and rebuild their temple.",
        "Van Praag states that the Ming court formed diplomatic missions with Tibet to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these missions were not diplomatic in nature, claiming that Tibetan regions were under Ming control due to Tibetan leaders being appointed as Ming officials. The collection of horses from Tibet was viewed as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were engaged in domestic affairs rather than foreign diplomacy. Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously purchased horses in the Kham region while battling Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also posits that the Tibetan lamas' embassies to the Ming court primarily aimed to facilitate commercial transactions between the lamas' large entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma\u0161 notes that while the Ming maintained a hands-off approach to Tibet and limited the number of Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming due to imperial patronage.",

Rumors circulated that she, or possibly Yuan Shikai, had ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor. An autopsy conducted decades later confirmed the presence of lethal levels of arsenic in the Emperor's body. Puyi, the first-born son of Prince Chun and the nephew of the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed his successor at a young age of two, leaving Zaifeng to hold the regency. As a result, General Yuan Shikai was dismissed from his previous positions of power. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet comprised of two vice-premiers, but this administration was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to the presence of five members of the royal family among the thirteen cabinet members.",
        "The plumage of birds is regularly lost and replaced, with the standard plumage of a bird that has lost its feathers after breeding being known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology, \"basic\" plumage. Breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. The process of losing and regrowing feathers, or \"moult,\" occurs annually in most species, although some may have two moults per year, and large birds of prey may only moult once every few years. The pattern of moult varies across species. In passerines, for example, the flight feathers are replaced one at a time, starting with the innermost primary feather. As the fifth or sixth primary feather is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries, starting from the innermost, begin to drop and this process continues until the outermost feathers are lost (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Anthropomorphic figurines were found in the Balkans around 6,000 BC, and in Central Europe by 5,800 BC. The Sesklo culture in Thessaly later expanded in the Balkans and gave rise to the Star\u010devo-K\ufffdr\ufffds, Linearbandkeramik, and Vin\u010da cultures. Neolithic traditions spread west and north to Northwestern Europe by around 4,500 BC through cultural diffusion and migration of peoples.

However, green also carries some contrary associations such as death, sickness, and the devil. In contrast, green is associated with positive symbols in China, representing fertility and happiness. Throughout history, green and red have been used to indicate social status, with green being worn by merchants, bankers, and the gentry, and red being the color of nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, for example, portrays a non-noble character as green-clad, while the British House of Commons features green benches while the House of Lords uses red. Green is also associated with safety and permission, with a green light indicating go-ahead and a green card permitting permanent residency.",
        "In the recent era, Libya made a comeback on the global stage. In 1999, the Libyan government secretly started negotiations with the British government to improve relations. In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing empathy for the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. At the same time, the Libyan government continued to suppress domestic Islamism. Gaddafi also advocated for the wider implementation of sharia law. During this time, Libya strengthened its ties with China and North Korea, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin visiting in April 2002. The Libyan government was influenced by the Iraq War, as they renounced possession of weapons of mass destruction in December 2003, dismantling their chemical and nuclear weapons programs. As a result, relations with the U.S. improved, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. Gaddafi traveled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels the following month, signaling improved relations.",

Constantius sent him 500 pieces of gold \"to bear his charges\" but Liberius refused them, saying he would give them to his flatterers. He also refused a similar present from the empress, telling the messenger to believe in Christ and not persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in the Church, but Liberius threw them out.

        "On April 26, 1864, the Montana Territory was formed when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools began to form in the area even before it was officially recognized as a territory, as families started to settle in the region. The initial schools were subscription schools, which were held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley in 1862, which had Indian children and children of Fort Owen employees as students. The first school term began in early winter and concluded on February 28. Mr. Robinson taught the classes. Another early subscription school was established by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. This school charged students $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly held its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, laying the groundwork for public education.",
        "The last key aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. It refers to one's feelings and thoughts about their self-perception and identity. Most theories on self-esteem emphasize the universal desire to maintain, protect, and enhance it across all genders and age groups. Contrary to the common belief, there is no empirical evidence to support a significant drop in self-esteem during adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem\" can fluctuate rapidly and cause significant distress and anxiety, the overall self-esteem remains stable throughout adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and some argue that more specific scales may provide a better understanding of the adolescent experience. Girls are likely to have high self-esteem when they engage in supportive relationships with friends, as the most important aspect of friendship for them is having someone who can provide social and moral support.",

Apple believed that Intel's CISC architecture would not be able to compete against RISC processors. Although the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could perform significantly better on a clock-for-clock basis, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance advantage over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who built their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple struggled to",
        "During the 1970s and 1980s, some hard rock bands managed to maintain successful recording careers. Bon Jovi continued to achieve commercial hits, including the double platinum-certified album Crush (2000) with the song \"It's My Life.\" AC/DC also released the platinum-certified album Stiff Upper Lip (2000). Aerosmith released the platinum album Just Push Play (2001), which featured a Top 10 hit \"Jaded\" and the blues cover album Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the 1990s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, making them the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums across five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne from 1997 to 2006 and Dio from 2006 to 2010) and even a one-off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), reigniting interest in their previous work.",
        "In order to avoid the potential for conflicting power supplies, sections of a power line that are fed from different substations should be isolated from each other. This isolation is typically achieved through the use of Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), which are typically installed at substations and midway between them. Neutral Sections consist of an earth wire segment separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, such as ceramic beads. This design ensures that the pantograph can smoothly transition between sections without creating an electrical arc, which could potentially cause damage to the system due to the higher voltage difference between the live sections and the potential lack of protection from the protective circuit breakers. The neutral section also helps to maintain a safe level of current flow in the event of a power failure or other disruption to the power supply.",
        "Carolingian art was produced for a small group of elite figures and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was characterized by a desire to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, while also being influenced by Insular art from the British Isles. Insular art blended the decorative energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles with Mediterranean forms, such as books, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. The majority of surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, which were originally created for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects made of precious metals were considered the most prestigious form of art, but most of them have been lost, except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and other finds like the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo, hoards from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain, and Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s near Byzantine.",
        "Cotton cultivation requires favorable conditions, such as a frost-free period, ample sunlight, and moderate rainfall, typically ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 inches). The soil should be fairly heavy, and nutrient levels do not need to be exceptional. These conditions are typically found in the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, a significant portion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that rely on irrigation. \n\nCotton production typically begins soon after the preceding autumn harvest. The crop is naturally perennial, but it is grown as an annual to help manage pests. In the Northern Hemisphere, planting in the spring occurs between the beginning of February and the beginning of June, depending on the region. The United States is known for its South Plains region, where cotton cultivation is prevalent.",
        "The book gained widespread translation during Darwin's lifetime, yet difficulties emerged when translating abstract concepts and metaphors. Some translations were influenced by the translator's personal agenda. To ensure accuracy, Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, asking potential translators to make their own arrangements with local publishers. Darwin welcomed Heinrich Georg Bronn, a renowned elderly naturalist and geologist, but the 1860 German translation included Bronn's own ideas, introducing controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\" and added essays on topics like the origin of life, concluding with a religious section inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn published a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggestions, but he tragically passed away from a heart attack. Darwin maintained close contact with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867.",
        "During the Capetian dynasty, France gradually expanded its influence over the nobility. Starting from \u00cele-de-France, the French kingdom gained control of more parts of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, they faced strong opposition from the Dukes of Normandy, who, under William the Conqueror (1035-1087, duke 1066-1087) and his successors, conquered England in 1066 and established a cross-channel empire that persisted through the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, with Robert Guiscard (1059-1085) establishing a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily. The Angevin dynasty, led by King Henry II (1154-1189) and his son Richard I (1189-1199), expanded English rule to include large parts of France.",
        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-best video game console of all time, from a field of 25. Although it wasn't the best-selling console of its generation, TechRadar deemed it the most influential, emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 a prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space.\" Five years after the Xbox 360's debut, the highly-acclaimed Kinect motion capture camera was released, setting a record as the fastest-selling consumer electronic device in history and extending the console's life. Edge ranked the Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993-2013 period, stating that it had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game. Though games like Killzone and Gran Turismo may not be on the same level as Halo, the Xbox 360 still had a significant impact on the industry.",
        "Vladimir was a prince when his dad, Sviatoslav I, passed away in 972. However, he needed to leave his homeland and seek shelter in Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother, Yaropolk, murdered his other brother, Oleg, and assumed control over Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative, Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reclaimed Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As the Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most outstanding accomplishment was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, when Vladimir decided to adopt a new faith instead of the traditional idol worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most respected advisors and warriors as emissaries to various parts of Europe. They visited various Christian places to gather more information about their faith.",

The initial coup in the area was successful, and the region remained under the control of Nationalist forces throughout the war. While there were no major battles, there was still repression and death. All political parties, labor unions, and Galician nationalist organizations were banned. The autonomy of Galicia, as well as Catalonia and the Basque provinces, was also revoked.

        "Most fatty acids are not essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, usually by breaking down other fatty acids and using energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two essential fatty acids must be included in the diet. A balance of essential fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, is also important for good health, although the exact mechanisms have not been fully understood. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are important building blocks for a class of compounds called prostaglandins, which have various functions throughout the body. They act like hormones in some ways. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is produced from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or can be obtained from marine sources, and is a key component of prostaglandin series 3, which plays a role in inflammation. The omega-6 fatty acid dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) is also a component of prostaglandin series 1, which has other functions.",
        "In ancient Rome, public priests were chosen by collegia, which allowed them to maintain permanent religious authority granted by the eternal divine. This ensured them lifetime influence, privilege, and immunity. Civil and religious law restricted the number of religious offices that could be held by an individual and their family. Religious law was based on tradition and collegial, informing political decisions and being difficult to exploit for personal gain. Being a priest was a costly honor, as they received no stipend. Instead, they relied on cult donations, which they must provide regardless of public funding shortages. A lifetime of service in military or political life was often the best way to secure a permanent priesthood.",

        "Charles Darwin was diligently working on his significant book about Natural Selection when, on June 18th, 1858, he received a parcel from Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace had been conducting research on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo) and included twenty pages outlining an evolutionary mechanism in the package. This response was in response to Darwin's recent encouragement, and Wallace requested that Darwin deem it worthy if so, to forward it to Sir Charles Lyell. The proposed mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory, and Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance... forestalled.\" He pledged to \"immediately write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose. In his letter, Darwin expressed concerns about his own originality, stating that it would be \"smashed.\" Sir Joseph Hooker and Sir Charles Lyell agreed that a joint publication incorporating Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 essay and his 1857 letter to Asa Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society. Accordingly, the papers titled \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\" were presented on July 1st, 1858.",

        "Many modern specialty matches have been developed, with unique winning conditions. One such match is the ladder match, which is quite common. In the basic version of the ladder match, wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is raised above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team must try to weaken each other long enough for one of them to climb the ladder and secure the prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes may include a championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that is important to the wrestlers involved in the match (e.g. one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring at the same time, resulting in 20-30 wrestlers in the ring. When the match begins, the wrestlers are left to fight each other until only one wrestler remains, who is declared the winner.",

In 288 BC, he was defeated when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and they quickly divided the kingdom among themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries, where he sought support and in the northern Peloponnese. He subsequently laid siege to Athens, which turned against him, but later struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, allowing him to cross over to Asia Minor to wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia.

        "The first notable publication that expressed scientific concepts and knowledge specifically for the general public, in their local language, and with an emphasis on reader enjoyment, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). This book was designed for women who had an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a clear and concise manner, compared to the complex articles, treatises, and books published by academic institutions and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as a completely new work that included \"short and simple rules and astronomical tables.\" The first introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to disseminate Newton's theories beyond academic institutions and universities.",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs conquered Iran and controlled it until 651 AD, converting many Iranians from their native beliefs of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic became the official language, while Persian remained the language of everyday communication and literature. During the Islamic Golden Age, Iran produced many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. The Safavid Dynasty, established in 1501, converted Iranians from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, making Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of the country. This transformation marked a significant turning point in Iranian and Muslim history. Under Nader Shah's rule in the early 19th century, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly ruling an empire that was arguably the most powerful in the world at the time. However, Iran lost significant territories in the Caucasus to neighboring Imperial Russia during the 19th century, including areas that had been part of the Iranian concept for centuries. This led to popular unrest and the eventual loss of more territories in the region.",

These tests involved the release of potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms without the public's knowledge. The Ministry of Defence claims that the tests were meant to simulate germ warfare and were harmless. However, families living near the testing sites have reported children with birth defects, physical and mental disabilities. Many of these families are calling for a public inquiry to investigate the impact of these tests. According to the report, millions of people were affected, including a period between 1961 and 1968 when over a million people along the south coast of England were exposed to bacteria, including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which simulate anthrax.",
        "During the early 1980s, several changes occurred in the lineup and direction of established hard rock acts. This period saw the passing of notable artists, such as Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, the drummer for Led Zeppelin. Following the disbandment of Led Zeppelin, AC/DC continued on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. This album became the fifth best-selling album of all time in the US and the second best-selling album worldwide. In contrast, Black Sabbath had parted ways with their original singer, Ozzy Osbourne, in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, who had previously been with Rainbow. This change gave the band a new sound and launched a period of creativity and popularity, starting with the release of Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne then embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), which featured American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and leaned more towards pop rock, whereas other acts, including",
        "From his diagrams of a few particles interacting within spacetime, Feynman was able to model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling for the fundamental forces. Feynman proposed an explanation for the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering, known as the parton model. This model complemented the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague, Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was unclear, as Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons as \"put-ons.\" In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were merely a means of keeping track of symmetry numbers, and not actual particles. The statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. However, the deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator in the late 1960s showed that quarks were indeed real, similar to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei.",

The album received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in just six days. The New York Times acknowledged the unconventional, unexpected release as a significant event.\n\nMusically, the album is an electro-R&B masterpiece that explores darker themes not previously explored in Beyonc\u00e9's work, such as bulimia, postnatal depression, and the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood. The single \"Drunk in Love,\" featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Antimicrobial agents found in ancient remedies have been documented for more than 2,000 years. Various ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Greeks, used selected molds and plant materials, extracts, to fight infections. Advances in the laboratory revealed the existence of natural antibacterial substances produced by microorganisms. This research led Louis Pasteur to theorize that interfering with the interaction between bacteria could provide the most promising treatment options. In 1877, Jean Paul Vuillemin, a French bacteriologist, introduced the term 'antibiosis,' which means \"against life.\" This term refers to the phenomenon where certain substances, discovered by Pasteur, inhibit the growth of bacteria.",
        "More often than not, when there are three or more parties involved, no single party is likely to attain power alone. In such situations, parties usually join forces to form coalition governments. This pattern has been increasingly prevalent in the Irish political landscape since the 1980s, and it is quite common in Germany, whether at the national or state levels, or in most local communities. This trend has also been observed in Iceland, where coalition governments have consistently formed since its establishment in 1944. Similarly, in Ireland, no single party has been able to maintain power on its own since 1989, and multiple coalition governments have been established. These coalitions have primarily been led by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. It is worth noting that political changes can often be more easily achieved through coalition governments compared to one-party or two-party dominant systems.",

However, not all metropolitan municipalities have followed suit, with the City of Glen Eira deciding not to become carbon neutral in 2009. Melbourne has a large urban footprint due to its low-density housing, resulting in a sprawling suburban area with high car dependence and limited public transportation outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city is non-native, with a majority of European origin, often hosting invasive species and noxious weeds. Several introduced urban pests, including the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling, and red fox, have negatively impacted the ecosystem.

        "In contrast to Scotland, which remained an independent kingdom, a significant shift occurred in 1603 when the King of Scotland inherited the English crown, as well as the Irish one. The 17th century was marked by political upheaval, religious division, and conflict. English colonization in Ireland during the 16th century was further extended by the establishment of large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. The religious divide intensified and the King in England faced conflict with the Parliament. A central point of contention was the King's policy of tolerance toward Catholicism. The ensuing English Civil War or the War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England, while Ireland, primarily Catholic, remained loyal to the king. Following the defeat of the Parliament's army, large-scale land transfers from the loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the foundations for a new Ascendancy class, which over the next century would undermine the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish populations.",

In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in the Battle of Delhi, expanding their territory. They continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and the Durrani Empire to enlarge their borders.\n\nAccording to Gordon, the Marathas methodically controlled new regions by starting with annual raids, followed by collecting ransoms from villages and towns. The declining Mughal Empire maintained nominal control, and eventually, the Marathas took over the area.\n\nThe Marathas built an efficient system of public administration, known for its attention to detail. This administration successfully raised revenue in districts that had recovered from years of raids, reaching levels previously enjoyed by the region.",

The majority of those listed were Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation was based on an existing Naval Intelligence index focusing on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast. However, many German and Italian nationals were also included on the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (usually conducted without warrants) began shortly after the attack, and over the next several weeks, more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast.

        "The effectiveness of the human immune system in responding to antigens depends on various factors such as age, antigen type, and maternal influences, as well as the location where the antigen is presented. Neonates, in particular, are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, as their innate and adaptive immune responses are greatly suppressed. After birth, a child's immune system responds better to protein antigens compared to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. This is especially true for neonates, who are more susceptible to infections caused by low virulence organisms such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Opsonicity and the ability to activate the complement cascade are limited in neonates, with newborns having an average C3 level that is only 65% of that found in adults. Moreover, their phagocytic activity is also significantly impaired, due to lower opsonicity and reduced up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limits the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells.",

There is usually a 15-minute break between halves. The end of the game is called full-time. The referee is responsible for keeping the time during the game, and may add extra time for stoppages like substitutions, injured players, and other interruptions. This added time is commonly called stoppage time, injury time, or loss time. The referee decides how long the stoppage time will be and signals the end of the game. In some matches, a fourth official is appointed to inform the referee of the amount of extra time to be added at the end of each half.",
        "There is usually a specific indication for identifying an infectious agent when it can aid in the treatment or prevention of a disease or advance knowledge of the course of an illness before effective therapeutic or preventative measures are developed. For instance, in the early 1980s, before the introduction of AZT for treating AIDS, the disease's progression was closely monitored by studying the composition of patient blood samples. While this did not provide additional treatment options for the patient, it did help researchers understand the course of the disease. These studies on the emergence of HIV in specific communities also allowed researchers to develop hypotheses about the routes of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in efforts to reduce the number of new infections. Specific serological diagnostic identification and later genotypic or molecular identification of HIV also enabled researchers to develop hypotheses about the time and geographic origins of the virus.",
        "Since regaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a bridge between East and West, implementing ambitious economic reforms and integrating with Western countries. Estonian market reforms have positioned the nation as a leading economy in the former COMECON area. In 1994, based on Milton Friedman's economic theories, Estonia adopted a flat tax, with a 26% uniform rate regardless of personal income. Over time, the personal income tax rate was progressively reduced: to 24% in 2005, then to 23% in 2006, and finally to 21% in 2008. The Estonian government designed euro coins in late 2004, and the euro was adopted as the country's currency on January 1, 2011 \u2013 later than initially planned due to persistent high inflation. An Estonian Land Value Tax is levied to fund local municipalities, although the tax is a state-level charge with 100% of revenue supporting Local Councils.",
        "The island of Saint Helena covers an area of 122 square kilometers and is primarily characterized by rugged terrain formed by volcanic activity. The most recent volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago. The coastlines are predominantly composed of volcanic rock, which makes the coastal regions warmer and drier than the interior. The highest point on the island, Diana's Peak, reaches 818 meters (2,684 feet) in elevation. The peak was designated as the island's first national park in 1996. Much of the island's landscape is covered by New Zealand flax, a remnant of former industries. However, there are also some original trees that have been augmented by plantations, such as those in the Millennium Forest project, which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was initially discovered, it was home to a unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's hinterland likely supported a dense tropical forest, while the coastal areas were likely quite picturesque.",
        "In the mid-1980s, several established bands experienced a resurgence in popularity. After an 8-year hiatus, Deep Purple reunited with their classic lineup to release the album Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, and was a platinum-seller in the US. Meanwhile, Van Halen, whose fourth album had slower sales, bounced back with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, and reached their commercial peak with the 1984 album. It peaked at number two on the Billboard album chart and the single \"Jump\" from the album topped the singles chart and remained there for several weeks. Heart, who struggled during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their ninth studio album, which reached number one and included four Top 10 singles, including their first number one hit.",
        "The United States has established a predominant two-party political system. Typically, this has been characterized by the presence of conservative and liberal parties, such as the Republican and Democratic parties, as the norm in American politics. The first parties were the Federalists and Republicans, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs lasted only for two decades before splitting over the issue of slavery, with those opposed joining the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties, such as the Libertarian Party, often receive limited support and are rarely the victors in elections. However, there have been instances where third parties have siphoned votes from major parties expected to win, such as in the election of 1912 with Theodore Roosevelt and in the election of 1968 with George Wallace.",
        "Notre Dame's conference affiliations changed for most sports, except for football and fencing, in July 2013 due to major conference realignment. The fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a time of instability in the Big East. They maintain their football independence and have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish had to find a new conference home after the Big Ten added the sport in 2013-14, leading to a cascade of conference moves that resulted in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012-13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After joining the ACC, the conference announced it would sponsor fencing starting in the 2014-15 school year. The origin of the \"Fighting Irish\" moniker has many theories, but it is known that the name was adopted.",
        "During the London torch relay, involving 80 torch-bearers, Sir Steve Redgrave, who began the relay, mentioned that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could understand why some would want to make it an issue. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan declined to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to take part and also speak against China. Norman Baker, a pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament, asked all torch-bearers to reconsider their participation. Amid pressure from both sides, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without handling it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by a mobile protective ring, as protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove, a demonstrator attempted to steal the torch from Konnie Huq during a brief struggle, while in another incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown afterwards.",
        "Jerusalem is a significant city for three main religions: Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. This is due to its host of places that hold great religious importance, such as the Old City, which contains the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Other religious sites in Israel include Nazareth, where Christians consider it the site of the Annunciation of Mary, Tiberias and Safed, two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, the White Mosque in Ramla, which is sacred to Islam as the tomb of the prophet Saleh, and the Church of Saint George in Lod, which is sacred to both Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr. There are also several other religious landmarks located in the West Bank, including Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem.",
        "Many non-alphanumeric characters in early typewriters had shifted positions corresponding to their positions on mechanical typewriters. Mechanical typewriters, such as the Remington No. 2 (1878), used a shift key, and early typewriters omitted digits 0 and 1, using O (capital letter O) and l (lowercase letter L) instead. However, once 0 and 1 became common, 1! and 0) pairs became standard. In ASCII,!\"#$% were placed in the second column, rows 1-5, corresponding to the digits 1-5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, as the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing the underscore ( _) character from the keyboard.",
        "Adolescence is a time of significant change within a family. Young children often assert their independence, but it is not until early adolescence that they begin to have a greater influence over family decisions. At this stage, they are seen by their parents as equals. The adolescent faces the challenge of becoming more independent while maintaining a close relationship with their parents. Puberty often leads to increased conflict between children and their parents, as well as a weaker bond within the family. Disagreements often focus on issues of control, such as curfew, clothing, and privacy. As adolescents spend more time with their friends, they may encounter influences that are in opposition to their parents' values. Social media has also played a role in increasing parent-adolescent disagreements.",
        "Microbiological cultures are a crucial tool used in diagnosing infectious diseases. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent, such as a bacterium or virus. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is tested for the presence of an infectious agent that can grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus, can be easily grown on nutrient agar, a solid medium that provides necessary carbohydrates and proteins for bacterial growth, as well as ample water. A single bacterium will develop into a visible mound on the surface of the plate, known as a colony. This colony may be separated from other colonies or blended together to form a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape, and form of a colony can be indicative of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (strain), and the environmental conditions that support its growth. Other ingredients may also be added to the plate to aid in identification.",
        "About 20% of students at Eton receive financial support, through a variety of bursaries and scholarships. The current headmaster, Tony Little, stated that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school regardless of his parents' income. In 2011, he said that approximately 250 boys received significant financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure increased to 263 students receiving around 60% of school fee assistance, while 63 students were educated for free. Little stated that in the short term, he wanted to ensure that approximately 320 students per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated for free, with the intention of increasing the number of students.",
        "Before creating Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor performed together in a band known as Smile. Freddie Mercury, then using his birth name Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara, admired Smile and encouraged them to try out more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggesting \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his well-known stage name. John Deacon was hired just before recording their self-titled debut album in 1973. Queen initially charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, released in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that brought them international success. The latter album included the track \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularized music videos. Their 1977 album, News of the World, included songs like \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" which have since become iconic anthems at sporting events.",
        "On March 13, the port of Clydebank in the upper Clyde near Glasgow was attacked by a bomb. Out of its 12,000 houses, only seven were left undamaged. Many other ports were also targeted, with Plymouth being attacked five times and other cities such as Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff suffering bombings. Cardiff was bombed on three separate occasions, and Portsmouth was devastated by five attacks. During this period, an average of 40,000 people lost their homes per week, reaching 148,000 in a single raid in March 1941. Despite the destruction, British ports continued to support the war industry and supplies from North America were still passing through them. Plymouth, due to its vulnerable location on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, faced the heaviest attacks. On March 10-11, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries, causing extensive damage to houses and commercial centers.",
        "The origins of collegiate a cappella singing are somewhat unclear, with the Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, established in 1873, considered possibly the oldest known group in this genre. However, the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which formed in 1909 and had Cole Porter as a member. Throughout the 20th century, a cappella groups grew in number and popularity. Notable historical groups that were formed during this time include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956). Alongside these men's groups, all-women a cappella groups also emerged, often as a humorous counterpart to the male groups. Examples include the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936) and The Shwiffs of Connecticut College.",
        "Communicating within peer groups enables adolescents to explore their emotions and self-identify while also developing and evaluating their social skills. These groups offer members opportunities to build social skills, such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose their peer groups based on shared characteristics that align with their own. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of their personal growth. Group norms and values are integrated into an adolescent's self-concept, and through learning new communication skills and reflecting on those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, they can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have a positive impact on individuals, such as enhancing academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another, they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging the use of drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and theft through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Additional evidence on peer groups can be found in research studies.",
        "After a period of division within the Liberal Party, former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock competed for leadership. During this time, Australia was experiencing the early 1990s recession, with high unemployment reaching 11.4% in 1992. In November 1991, under leader Dr. John Hewson, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document, which proposed radical economic measures to stimulate growth. These measures included the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), changes to Medicare such as ending bulk billing for non-concession holders, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, changes to industrial relations, the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut for middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the elimination of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. This policy marked a significant departure from the Keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.",
        "The references to legal matters in Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" have drawn the attention of legal scholars, particularly when considering scenes outside the courtroom. Claudia Durst Johnson mentioned in her work that there is a greater number of legal scholar's articles published in law journals than in literary ones. Charles Lamb, a 19th-century essayist, wrote, \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are made through spitting on one's palm and discussing laws with Atticus. Johnson notes that Bob Ewell's actions, such as hunting and trapping out of season, are also legal matters that are discussed. Many social codes are broken in symbolic courtrooms, such as Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who has been exiled by society for marrying a black woman and having interracial children.",
        "In late 1975, Queen released the album 'A Night at the Opera', which took its name from a popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Similar to its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. One notable track is the eight-minute epic, \"The Prophet's Song\", which features a canon with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. Another standout track is the Mercury-penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", which includes a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, going triple platinum in the United States. It was also voted the 13th greatest album of all time by the British public in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. Additionally, it has ranked highly in international polls. In a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public voting it the 28th greatest of all time. 'A Night at the Opera' has frequently been praised for its musical diversity and innovation.",
        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception is primarily referenced by Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became increasingly prominent among Byzantine theologians who drew from Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. While hymnographers and scholars, such as Emperor Justinian I, referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first comprehensive commentary on Nazianzen's views can be found in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In Sophronius' writings, Mary is portrayed as already immaculate at the time of the Annunciation, with John the Baptist being considered \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" due to her surpassing holiness. Sophronius' teachings were further developed by St. John Damascene, who, in addition to praising the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, bestowed upon her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\"",
        "Several protests took place along the torch relay route. Members of the Hong Kong Alliance for Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved inflatable plastic Olympic flames to symbolize democracy. They demanded accountability for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also participated in the protest, saying \"I am very proud that in Hong Kong, we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were met with insults such as \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!\" and \"I love the Communist Party\" from a crowd of torch supporters. Meanwhile, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front held orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers commented in Mandarin putonghua, attempting to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag.",
        "Zhejiang's key manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. Recently, Zhejiang has followed its own development model known as the \"Zhejiang model\", which emphasizes prioritizing and supporting entrepreneurship, focusing on small businesses that respond to market needs, large public investments in infrastructure, and producing low-cost bulk goods for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has become one of the wealthiest provinces in China. However, some economists are concerned that this model may not be sustainable due to its inefficiency and the unreasonable demands it places on raw materials and public utilities. Additionally, it may also be a dead-end for small businesses in Zhejiang that produce cheap bulk goods, as they may struggle to transition to more sophisticated or technologically advanced industries.",
        "In December, several famous people, including Beyonc\u00e9, joined forces to create a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan,\" which is an initiative led by 950 U.S. mayors and others aiming to persuade the federal government to reconsider its gun control laws following the tragic events at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Beyonc\u00e9 became an advocate for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign by donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its accompanying music video, which was filmed at the United Nations. In 2013, it was announced that she would collaborate with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign aimed at promoting female empowerment. This campaign was launched on February 28 and featured Beyonc\u00e9's new music. A concert in support of the cause was held on June 1, 2013 in London, and featured performances by Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora, among others. Ahead of the concert, Beyonc\u00e9 appeared in a campaign video released on May 15, 2013, highlighting her dedication to these important causes.",
        "Although Ottoman madrasas focused on several branches of study, such as calligraphic, oral, and intellectual sciences, their primary function was to serve as Islamic centers for spiritual learning. \"The aim of all knowledge, particularly spiritual sciences, is to know God.\" Religion plays a significant role in determining the importance of each discipline, as \u0130nalc\u0131k states: \"Those that benefit religion are good, while sciences like astrology are bad.\" Despite including subjects like mathematics and logic in their curriculum, all teachings were rooted in religion, even mathematics. According to Ottoman medrese ulama, hostility towards logic and mathematics was unnecessary, as these subjects helped cultivate critical thinking and thereby revealed divine truths. \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that philosophy was only allowed within the constraints of Islamic thought.",
        "The area currently known as Galicia has been inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period. The name \"Galicia\" originates from the Gallaeci, a Celtic people living north of the Douro river during the final millennium BC, in a region that is largely coincident with the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC and became a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal), which was subsequently incorporated into the Visigoth kingdom in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but in 740, Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time, it was allied with the kingdom of Asturias.",
        "Upon its release, Twilight Princess was widely acclaimed as the finest Zelda game ever by numerous critics, including those from 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post. Game Informer hailed it as \"a creative masterpiece that rivals the best in Hollywood\". GamesRadar described it as \"a game that deserves nothing but the highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed it as \"the finest videogame experience\". Though designed for the GameCube, which has technical limitations compared to the next-gen consoles, Twilight Princess's visuals were praised for its art style and animation. Both IGN and GameSpy noted blurry textures and low-resolution characters, but Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, stating that \"the cutscenes are the best\".",
        "The islands have varying altitudes, with central regions of Ireland and southern Great Britain being relatively low. The lowest point in the islands is Holme, in Cambridgeshire, at -2.75 meters (-9.02 feet) below sea level. In contrast, the Scottish Highlands in northern Great Britain consist of mountains, with Ben Nevis being the highest point on the islands, standing at 1,343 meters (4,406 feet). Other mountainous regions include Wales and parts of Ireland, although only seven peaks in these areas exceed 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) in height. The lakes on the islands are generally not large, with Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland being an exception, covering 150 square miles (390 square kilometers). The largest freshwater lake in Great Britain is Loch Lomond, spanning 27.5 square miles (71 square kilometers), while Loch Ness, by volume, and Loch Morar, by depth, are the most significant freshwater bodies in the British Isles.",
        "Although Britain emerged victorious in the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for centuries, lay in ruins and was home to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt and only averted insolvency in 1946 after negotiating a US$4.33 billion loan (equivalent to US$56 billion in 2012). This loan was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were rising in the colonies of European nations. The situation was further complicated by the increasing Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, both of which were opposed to European colonialism in principle, but American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, leading the United States to support the continued existence of the British Empire in order to contain Communist expansion.",
        "In the works of Homer, the \"Hellenes\" are referred to as a smaller, settled tribe residing in Thessaly's Phthia region, with their warriors under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle states that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that they were previously known as Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the progenitor of the Hellenes, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled over Phthia, the sole survivors after the great deluge. It appears that this myth originated when Greek tribes began to separate and establish themselves in distinct regions throughout Greece, signifying a shared ancestry. Aristotle referred to this ancient period as Hellas (\u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2).",
        "Nonetheless, the Luftwaffe continued to pose a significant threat. With the German invasion of Western Europe, there was growing concern about the intensification of submarine and air attacks on British sea routes. Should the Germans succeed, this could have far-reaching consequences for the course of the war. Liverpool, as a vital hub for convoys traveling through the Western Approaches from North America, became a focal point for these efforts. The city's rail network expanded to accommodate the increased traffic, and military operations were conducted against it during the Liverpool Blitz. These attacks resulted in significant damage to shipping, with 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of cargo being sunk and another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. The Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison, also expressed concerns about the impact on civilian morale, noting the growing sense of defeatism. Other sources reported that half of the port's 144 berths were rendered unusable, and cargo unloading capacity was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked, making it difficult for ships to leave the harbor. On May 8, 1941, 57 ships were destroyed.",
        "The last major building work was carried out during King George V's reign, in 1913. Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble Lyme Park in Cheshire by Giacomo Leoni. This new facade, made of Portland stone, was designed to be the backdrop for the Victoria Memorial, a large statue of Queen Victoria placed outside the main gates. King George V, who succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality and placed greater emphasis on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919), Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), earning the palace a nomination for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival in 2009 as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "After the brief peace in Europe, Napoleon had the opportunity to focus on France's overseas territories. In 1801, Saint-Domingue had gained significant political autonomy with Toussaint Louverture becoming the de facto dictator. Napoleon saw this as a chance to regain the once-wealthy colony and signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention abolished slavery in 1794, but under the terms of Amiens, Napoleon agreed not to abolish slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had not been implemented. As a result, the Law of 20 May did not apply to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, despite some officials using the peace to reinstate slavery in some places. The Law of 20 May officially re-established the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies, but did not reinstate slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition led by General Leclerc to restore control over these territories.",
        "Mary's sinlessness and exemption from any taint were doctrines known to Greek theologians in Byzantium. St. Gregory Nazianzen, for example, explained that Jesus and Mary were purified at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) and that this purification referred to a sinless nature that shone in a moment of grace (such as at Jesus' Baptism). Nazianzen referred to Mary as \"prokathartheisa,\" or \"pre-purified.\" He likely sought to explain the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple by considering their human natures to be equally holy and therefore purified in a moment of grace and glory. Nazianzen's teachings on Mary's purification were likely linked to the growing devotion to the Mother of God around the time of Christmas in and around Constantinople.",
        "The state experienced a relatively tranquil atmosphere in comparison to other parts of the nation due to its close ties with the United States until 1841. In 1843, the possibility of conflict was anticipated by the state government, leading to the reinforcement of defensive lines along the border with Texas. Military supplies were sent to fully equip the armed forces, and measures were taken to enhance efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border was established by the state, comprising light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials, at a cost of 160,603 pesos per year. During the early 1840s, private individuals attempted to prevent the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States from entering the nation, but as these suppliers were based in central Mexico, the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844. Fearing further conflict, the state legislature enlisted 6,000 men on July 11, 1846.",
        "In spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed Swiss Alps into Italy, planning to surprise the Austrian armies that occupied peninsula while Napoleon was still in Egypt. [Note 5] After a tough crossing over the Alps, French army entered Northern Italy with little opposition. While one French army approached from the north, Austrians were occupied with another stationed in Genoa, which was under siege from a strong force. The fierce resistance of this French army, led by Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, granted the northern striking force valuable time to carry out their operations with minimal interference. After several days of searching, the two armies finally clashed at Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle initially favored the Austrians, as their initial attack surprised the French and pushed them back. However, despite their numerical superiority, the Austrians failed to capitalize on their initial advantage and eventually suffered defeat.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans and Argives are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters, the Danaides, were forced to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom in Tartarus. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphus) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia.",
        "In 1969, Arnold Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland, an English teacher, with whom he lived until 1974. Schwarzenegger discussed her in his memoir in 1977: \"She was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, stable life, and I was not a well-balanced person, and detested the idea of a regular life.\" Baker, on the other hand, described Schwarzenegger as joyful, charismatic, adventurous, and athletic, but later claimed that he became \"unbearable\" and \"classically conceited,\" with the world revolving around him. She published her memoir in 2006, titled \"Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak.\" Although Baker occasionally depicted Schwarzenegger in a negative light, the latter contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword and also met with her for three hours. For instance, Baker only discovered his infidelity after their separation and discussed a tumultuous relationship.",
        "The environment of an adolescent plays a significant role in shaping their sense of self. However, most research focuses on white, middle-class teenagers. Studies indicate that those with a privileged upbringing tend to develop their identity more successfully. Identity formation is a crucial period in one's life, as demographic trends reveal that the transition to adulthood is taking longer than it did in the middle of the 20th century. As a result, the period of youth, encompassing late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more significant stage in the life course. This has led to various factors becoming crucial during the development of an adolescent's identity, including commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media usage. All these factors are influenced by the environment in which an adolescent grows up. Those from privileged backgrounds generally have more opportunities and better circumstances.",
        "The landscapes of Thuringia are diverse. In the far north, the Harz mountains dominate the landscape, followed by the fertile Goldene Aue around Nordhausen, where the Helme river is the most important. To the north-west, the Eichsfeld region features hilly and sometimes forested areas, with the Leine river flowing through it. The central and northern part of Thuringia is defined by the Thuringian Basin, a very fertile and flat area around the Unstrut river, surrounded by the following hill chains (clockwise from the north-west): D\ufffdn, Hainleite, Windleite, Kyffh\u00e4user, Hohe Schrecke, Schm\ufffdcke, Finne, Ettersberg, Steigerwald, Thuringian Forest, H\ufffdrselberge, and Hainich. Within the Basin, smaller hill chains such as Fahner H\ufffdhe and Heilinger H\ufffdhen can also be found. To the south of the Thuringian Basin, the largest mountain range in Thuringia is marked by the Thuringian Forest in the north-west, the Thuringian Highland in the middle, and the Franconian Forest in the south.",
        "The relationships that adolescents form with their peers, family, and others in their social circle are essential for their social development. As adolescents explore the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become emotionally invested in their friendships. While this is generally not harmful, it can become a problem if these friends expose the adolescent to dangerous situations due to peer pressure.\n\nAdolescence is a critical time in social development because this is the first time when individuals have the freedom to make their own decisions. However, this also makes it a vulnerable period. The relationships that adolescents form during this time play a crucial role in their social development because peers can have a significant influence on their behavior. These relationships become even more important as they help adolescents understand and navigate the complexities of social interactions.",

        "Some rock musicians nowadays prefer single-stringed electric mandolins over double-stringed acoustic ones. Tim Brennan from the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys is one example. The band also utilizes traditional Celtic instruments, including mandolins, tin whistles, and Great Highland bagpipes. According to the band, these instruments contribute to their distinctive sound. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" featured a few mandolin riffs played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in several other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the rock and alternative charts. Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has frequently used the mandolin, most notably on his recordings.",
        "Predators and prey often switch roles in an ecosystem. For instance, blue jays may prey on insects but could be prey for cats and snakes. In turn, snakes might be prey for hawks. One way to classify predators is by their trophic level. Herbivores, or primary consumers, eat autotrophs, the producers of the food chain, while secondary consumers, which include carnivores, feed on heterotrophs like animals. Tertiary and quartary consumers can also be found at higher trophic levels, but due to limited energy transfer, the hierarchy of predation usually doesn't extend more than six or seven levels. At some point, the energy decreases too much to sustain the higher predators, and the hierarchy may only go up to three levels. For example, a lion preying on large herbivores like wildebeest would be classified as a predator at a trophic level.",
        "In 680, Ibn al-Zubayr escaped from Medina to Mecca. He learned about Husayn's opposition to Yazid I, and the people of Kufa sent a message to Husayn, asking him to take over their support. Husayn sent his cousin, Muslim bin Agail, to investigate their intentions. When Yazid I discovered this, he ordered Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, the ruler of Basrah, to stop the people of Kufa from supporting Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd around Muslim bin Agail and capture him. Realizing that Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been sent to prevent Husayn from gaining support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to warn him against coming to Kufa. This request was denied, and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad returned to Kufa with his captive.",
        "On September 1, 1870, the battle began with the Army of Ch\u00e2lons, consisting of 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons, and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies, which had a total of 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. However, by 11:00, Prussian artillery inflicted significant damage on the French forces, and more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. Despite this, the French cavalry, led by General Marguerite, attempted three desperate charges on the nearby village of Floing, where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Unfortunately, General Marguerite was killed during the first charge, and the subsequent charges resulted in heavy losses for the French. By the end of the day, the French forces had suffered significant setbacks and were unable to break through the Prussian defenses."
