        "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the",
        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as",
        "Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life. Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised",

        "Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in",
        "The '98 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Caray. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill and the signing of Henry Rodríguez, known affectionately as \"H-Rod\" to bat cleanup provided protection for Sammy Sosa in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. Kevin Tapani led the club with a career high 19 wins, Rod Beck anchored a strong bullpen and Mark Grace turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower Kerry Wood. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the Houston Astros, a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname \"Kid K,\" and ultimately earned him the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the",
        "In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of",
        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also",
        "The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now[when?] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena.[citation needed] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that \"individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, on the extent to which they validate a \"preferred organizational self\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005, p. 169). Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway 2005). \"The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices.\" Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life (Tracy & Scott 2006, p. 33).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.",
        "The political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went",
        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as",
        "Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the",
        "But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently",
        "The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.[nb 10] John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including",
        "A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of",
        "Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn’t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower",
        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken",

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Hundred Yue, including the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The kingdom of Yue began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the Spring and Autumn Period. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was located in northern Zhejiang. Shiji claims that its leaders were descended from the Shang founder Yu the Great. Evidence suggests that Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue possessed their own culture and history that are different from those kingdoms in north and central China, whose cultures and histories were carefully recorded in chronicles and histories during the Spring and Autumn Period and into the Qin dynasty.

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars",

Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \"Gaddafi's Pet Project\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981.

More than 8,000 riot police were deployed to guard the 24-kilometre route, which began at Olympic Park, which was built when Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. On the day of the torch relay in Seoul, Chinese students clashed with protesters, throwing rocks, bottles, and punches. A North Korean defector whose brother defected to China but was captured and executed by the DPRK, attempted to set himself on fire in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees.

Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia. Madison issued four religious proclamations while President, but vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment. On the other hand, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Years before the ratification of the Constitution, Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\" After retiring from the presidency, Madison wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\" \" \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,\" Madison wrote, and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government",
        "The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil",
        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade",

However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During The Great Game era, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yaqub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing empire as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930.

        "BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \"Cougars\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on",
        "John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent",

After the Doolittle Raid, the Japanese army conducted a massive sweep through Zhejiang and Jiangxi of China, now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, with the goal of searching out the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases.

        "Dorgon's controversial July 1645 edict (the \"haircutting order\") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore",
        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people. An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other",

In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.

The date of the assignment was retroactively established on Armistice Day. It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871. The movement started with the first election for the Reichstag; those elected were called \"les députés protestataires\", and until the fall of Bismarck in 1890, they were the only deputies elected by the Alsatians to the German",
        "As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures",
        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it",

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team.

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at",

        "Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The third rail was below street level. The tram picked up the current through a plough (U.S. \"plow\") accessed through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of",

The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of",
        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated",
        "Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign",
        "Critics labelled Gaddafi \"despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid\", with western governments and press presenting him as the \"vicious dictator of an oppressed people\". During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\". Opponents were critical of Libya's human rights abuses; according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others, hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial, and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution, most notably in the Abu Salim prison, including an alleged massacre on 29 June 1996 in which HRW estimated that",
        "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing. Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the",
        "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history, first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy.[disputed – discuss] After the fall of the United Monarchy the land was divided into Israel and Judah. The term Jew originated from the Roman \"Judean\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In 586 BC, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless.

        "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corvée\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage",

Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers. Nonetheless, this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as \"The Royal Cabinet\" because among the thirteen cabinet members, five",
        "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap. A small number of species, such as",

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.",

In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week.

Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite",

Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering didn't help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other.

It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine",

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.

        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie.

They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035–1087), conquered England (r. 1066–87) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily.

        "In 2009, IGN named the Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, out of a field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential, by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it \"proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space\". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating \"It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's",
        "Vladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians",
        "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist (Franco's army's) hands throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fernández Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists",
        "Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1",
        "Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both:",

        "Darwin was hard at work on his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency",

        "Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize). Another common specialty match is known as the battle royal. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple",

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university. Francesco Algarotti,",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs invaded Iran and conquered it by 651 AD, largely converting Iranian people from their indigenous faiths of Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Arabic replaced Persian as the official language, while Persian remained the language of both ordinary people and of literature. Iran became a major contributor to the Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. Establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501, converted the Iranian people from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, and made Twelver Shia Islam the official religion of Iran. Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. During the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus which made part of the concept of Iran for centuries, to neighboring Imperial Russia.

        "A government report covered by the Guardian in 2002 indicates that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence \"turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public\" and many of these tests \"involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.\" The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. Still, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. According to the report these tests affected estimated millions of people including one period between 1961 and 1968 where \"more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii, which mimics anthrax.\" Two",
        "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including",
        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in",

        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"against life\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed.

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish",

The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region.

The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.

        "The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.

        "A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board",

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins",

The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections.

        "Of the 80 torch-bearers in London, Sir Steve Redgrave, who started the relay, mentioned to the media that he had received e-mailed pleas to boycott the event and could \"see why they would like to make an issue\" of it. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it. The London relay saw the torch surrounded by what the BBC described as \"a mobile protective ring.\" Protests began as soon as Redgrave started the event, leading to at least thirty-five arrests. In Ladbroke Grove a demonstrator attempted to snatch the torch from Konnie Huq in a momentary struggle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was set off near the torch. The Chinese ambassador carried the torch through Chinatown after",

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'() – early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from",
        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social",
        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria",

The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video.

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily",
        "It is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began. The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).

        "Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers",

The Australian economy was facing the early 1990s recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of \"dry\", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments.

The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season?

        "In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced. Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. In \"The Prophet's Song\", an eight-minute epic, the middle section is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, \"Love of My Life\", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies. The album was very successful in Britain, and went triple platinum in the United States. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll. It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\" This",

Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable plastic Olympic flames, which they said symbolised democracy. They wanted accountability for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage.

        "Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.",

As İnalcık mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" – key word being \"divine\".

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom",

Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best",

        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in",

The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an",

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.",
        "The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to",
        "Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted",

In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd",

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to",

        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general.",

        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept",

        "Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on",
        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which",

Al-Husayn sent his cousin Muslim bin Agail to verify if they would rally behind him. When the news reached Yazid I, he sent Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad, ruler of Basrah, with the instruction to prevent the people of Kufa rallying behind Al-Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad managed to disperse the crowd that gathered around Muslim bin Agail and captured him. Realizing Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad had been instructed to prevent Husayn from establishing support in Kufa, Muslim bin Agail requested a message to be sent to Husayn to prevent his immigration to Kufa. The request was denied and Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad",
        "On 1 September 1870, the battle opened with the Army of Châlons, with 202 infantry battalions, 80 cavalry squadrons and 564 guns, attacking the surrounding Prussian Third and Meuse Armies totaling 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons and 774 guns. General De Wimpffen, the commander of the French V Corps in reserve, hoped to launch a combined infantry and cavalry attack against the Prussian XI Corps. But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield. The French cavalry, commanded by General Marguerite, launched three desperate attacks on the nearby village of Floing where the Prussian XI Corps was concentrated. Marguerite was killed leading the very first charge and the two additional charges led to nothing but heavy losses. By the end of the day, with no hope of breaking"

        "Similar to reptiles, birds are mainly uricotelic, meaning their kidneys eliminate nitrogenous waste by converting it into uric acid and excreting it through the ureters into the intestine, as opposed to urea or ammonia. Unlike reptiles, birds lack a urinary bladder or external urethral opening, except for the ostrich, with uric acid being expelled alongside feces as a semi-solid waste. Nonetheless, certain birds like hummingbirds may exhibit facultative ammonotelism, releasing a majority of their nitrogenous waste as ammonia. Birds also excrete creatine instead of creatinine found in mammals. This waste, along with intestinal matter, exits through the cloaca, a versatile opening used for waste elimination, reproduction, egg-laying, and in many bird species, regurgitating pellets. In Palaeognathae and Anseriformes, except for kiwis, the cloaca serves various functions.",
        "Mammalian hair, also referred to as pelage, can exhibit color differences among populations, individuals within a population, and even within the same individual. Variability in light and dark shades is a common trait in mammalian species. While age can be a factor in determining color variation, other factors also play a role. Selective pressures, such as interactions with the environment or other populations, often drive variations in mammalian coloration to promote survival. Camouflage is believed to be a key factor influencing coloration in mammals, alongside evidence suggesting that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes also play a role in shaping color evolution. Camouflage stands out as the primary mechanism driving color variation in mammals.",
        "Education holds significant importance in Israeli culture, tracing back to Ancient Israel where it formed a cornerstone of societal norms. Within Israeli society, higher education is perceived as a crucial factor for upward social mobility and improved economic standing. The cultural significance of education can be traced back to the historical division within the Jewish community, dating from the Renaissance to the emergence of Zionism in the late 19th century. Jewish communities in the Levant were pioneers in implementing mandatory education, whereby the collective responsibility of the community, alongside parents, was to educate future generations. Present-day Jewish culture continues to prioritize academic advancement and intellectual pursuits, reflected in the nation's commendable university enrollment rates. This strong emphasis on education underscores the deep-rooted value that Israeli society places on higher learning.",

Established in 1881, the newspaper is run exclusively by undergraduates and is published on weekdays throughout the academic year. Despite catering to the Northwestern community, The Daily operates independently from the university and relies solely on advertising revenue for support. It is owned by the Students Publishing Company. North by Northwestern, an online undergraduate magazine, was founded in September 2006 by students from the Medill School of Journalism. Published on weekdays, the magazine provides regular updates on news stories and special events throughout the day and also on weekends. Additionally, North by Northwestern produces a quarterly print magazine.

        "After the collapse of Wu and the upheaval caused by the Wu Hu rebellion against the Jin dynasty (265–420), many prominent Chinese families aligned themselves with the non-Chinese rulers and conquerors in the northern regions. Some experienced a decline in social status and sought sanctuary south of the Yangtze River. Among these refugees from northern China, a portion likely settled in the vicinity of Hangzhou. One notable example is the Zhuge clan, descendants of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a prominent chancellor of the state of Shu Han in northern China during the Three Kingdoms era. They established an enclosed community known as Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun) on the outskirts of Hangzhou, comprising solely of individuals bearing the surname \"Zhuge.\" This village deliberately maintained seclusion from neighboring areas for generations, only recently becoming more widely recognized. This scenario implies that a select group of influential Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have sought asylum in this manner.",
        "The '98 season commenced on a solemn tone following the passing of the iconic announcer Harry Caray. With Sandberg's retirement and Dunston's trade creating gaps in the team, the Cubs signed Henry Rodríguez, affectionately known as \"H-Rod,\" to bolster the lineup and protect Sammy Sosa. Rodríguez excelled by hitting 31 home runs in his debut Chicago season. Kevin Tapani achieved a personal best of 19 wins, Rod Beck excelled as the bullpen anchor, and Mark Grace delivered one of his finest performances. The Cubs garnered substantial media coverage in 1998, with Sosa and rookie pitcher Kerry Wood emerging as the focal points. Wood's standout moment came when he tied the MLB record by striking out 20 Houston Astros players in a single game. His impressive strikeout record led to the moniker \"Kid K\" and the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year title. Sosa also shined, notably setting a league record for most home runs in a month by hitting 20 in June.",
        "In today's world, teenagers encounter various challenges as they navigate their evolving sexuality. While issues like emotional distress (stemming from fears of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not exclusive to adolescence, problems like teenage pregnancy (resulting from the lack of contraception use or failure) are commonly regarded as social concerns in many Western societies. It is concerning that one out of four sexually active teenagers will acquire an STI. In the United States, adolescents often opt for activities other than intercourse, believing it lowers the risk of STIs, yet clinicians nationwide observe an increase in herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV) diagnoses, the latter causing genital warts and affecting approximately 15 percent of individuals.",
        "Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages such as Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian of different regions and ethnic groups evolved and branched out autonomously. Prior to the 19th century, these languages were collectively known as \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\", or \"Croatian\". The term Serbo-Croatian was coined by Jacob Grimm in 1824, further popularized by the Vienna linguist Jernej Kopitar in the subsequent decades, and formally adopted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. During that period, the lands of Serbs and Croats were under the rule of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. The language was officially referred to as Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats commonly identified the language as \"Serbian\" and \"Croatian\" respectively, without implying a distinction between the two. Moreover, in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were regarded as three names denoting a single language.",
        "Identity development is a crucial phase during adolescence when individuals typically embark on the quest for self-discovery. This period marks a willingness among teenagers to experiment with various behaviors and styles in order to unearth their true selves. Essentially, adolescents are inclined to explore multiple identities before settling on one that resonates with them the most. Nonetheless, shaping and preserving one's identity during the teenage years prove to be challenging owing to a myriad of factors like family dynamics, surroundings, and societal standing. Research indicates that this progression is better characterized as identity development rather than formation, underscoring a standard process of evolution in both the essence and framework of self-identification.",
        "Similar to Egypt, the vast Seleucid Empire was primarily governed by a Greco-Macedonian ruling class. The influential Greek community in urban centers, mainly consisting of emigrants from Greece, formed the predominant elite. Cities like Antioch, the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia, and Dura-Europos were among those established, retaining customary Greek city-state structures such as assemblies and councils, though real power lay with Seleucid authorities. In addition to these urban areas, numerous Seleucid garrisons, military settlements, and Greek villages were strategically placed across the empire to solidify control. This Greco-Macedonian demographic, along with the establishment of military outposts, played a crucial role in the Seleucid governance.",
        "Numerous research traditions are currently leveraging the concept of identity to analyze various phenomena. Identity and its formation have significant implications, particularly evident in professional environments. This is notably challenging in roles associated with stigma or \"dirty work\" (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) suggest that individuals are drawn to or deterred from specific jobs based on how well they align with their desired professional identity. Different jobs come with distinct societal perceptions. Tracy illustrates this with the case of correctional officers striving to shed the label of \"glorified maids\" (Tracy & Tretheway, 2005). \"The process through which individuals rationalize and determine the worth of different career choices\" includes factors such as job satisfaction and overall well-being (Tracy & Scott, 2006). Individuals in such professions often consider aspects like workplace contentment and their general life quality.",
        "Emotions play a crucial role in driving social interactions and relationships, as they are closely linked to the body's stress mechanisms. Specifically, emotions are intertwined with the anti-stress system, including an oxytocin-related mechanism, which is pivotal in forming bonds. Individual emotional traits impact social bonding and overall adaptability within intricate social structures. These traits are not unique to humans but are also observed across various species and biological groups, underpinned by genetic inheritance and transmission. Genetic information stored in DNA dictates the synthesis of proteins essential for cell functioning, with zygotes inheriting genetic material from parental germ cells. Throughout evolution, heritable characteristics that facilitated the survival of previous generations are perpetuated.",
        "Stanley Schachter built upon the research of Spanish physician Gregorio Marañón, who administered epinephrine to patients and inquired about their subsequent feelings. Marañón observed that although the patients experienced sensations, they struggled to identify these feelings without a specific trigger. Schachter concurred with the significance of physiological responses in emotions, proposing that these reactions facilitated a deliberate cognitive assessment of the arousing situation, ultimately shaping the individual's emotional encounter. Therefore, emotions were believed to result from a dual process: initial physiological arousal followed by the actual emotional experience. For instance, a scenario involving the sighting of a bear in the kitchen could trigger physiological responses like a pounding heart, prompting the emotional response.",
        "The political unrest persisted as John considered forming an alliance with the recently returned French king, Philip II, following the crusade. Seeking to gain control of Normandy, Anjou, and other French territories held by Richard, John entertained the idea of siding with Philip. However, his mother advised against it. Longchamp, who had previously departed England due to Walter's involvement, made a comeback and contended that his removal as justiciar was unjust. John intervened and quashed Longchamp's assertions in exchange for support from the royal administration, including a confirmation of his position as the heir to the throne. In Richard's prolonged absence post-crusade, John began to insinuate that his brother might be deceased or permanently missing. In reality, Richard had been apprehended by the Duke of Austria en route to England and handed over to Emperor Henry VI for ransom. John capitalized on the situation and took advantage of the opportunity.",
        "In the Early Modern period, universities initially followed the academic curriculum of the Middle Ages, encompassing natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy, law, grammar, and rhetoric, with a heavy emphasis on Aristotle, Galen, and Arabic influences in medicine. The emergence of humanism played a pivotal role in reshaping academia. The introduction of humanist scholars to university faculties marked a shift towards the studia humanitatis, transforming the teaching of grammar and rhetoric. Humanist professors prioritized cultivating students' writing and speaking skills, their ability to translate and interpret classical texts, and their moral conduct. This humanist approach influenced other scholars in the university, impacting their linguistic abilities concerning ancient texts and promoting the significance of these texts. Even medical professors like Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre, and William Cop often adopted and imparted humanist perspectives in their teachings.",
        "Candidates from the Democratic Party were consistently winning local elections, strengthening the city's connections to the South and the dominant political party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood urged the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States following the South's secession, although no action was taken on his proposal. The introduction of new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865) sparked outrage, as wealthier individuals could avoid service by paying a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute. This discontent culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863, primarily involving working-class ethnic Irish individuals. Tensions escalated to include attacks on New York's upper class, followed by violence against black residents and their belongings, as Irish immigrants and African Americans fiercely competed for employment opportunities over the previous decade. The rioters set fire to the Colored Orphan Asylum, yet over 200 children were safely rescued due to the efforts of the community.",
        "However, by the mid-18th century, a shift occurred during the French Enlightenment, where the term took on a more ideological connotation. An article published in a French Enlightenment periodical in 1765 by an anonymous author discussed the concept of \"The general love of humanity,\" a virtue previously unnamed but now termed 'humanism' to signify its beauty and necessity. Subsequently, throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, various grassroots philanthropic and charitable organizations emerged with the goal of enhancing human welfare and knowledge dissemination, some with Christian affiliations and others without. Following the French Revolution, the notion that human virtue could be fostered solely through human rationality, detached from established religious bodies, was linked by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau, leading to violent debates.",
        "The outcome led to a series of inventive yet unpopular financial actions. John imposed scutage payments a total of eleven times during his seventeen-year rule, in stark contrast to the cumulative eleven times instituted by the prior three rulers. Many instances saw these payments enforced even in the absence of active military operations, deviating from the original purpose of scutage as a substitute for direct military duty. John exploited his authority to demand relief payments upon the inheritance of estates and castles, at times demanding exorbitant sums that exceeded the financial capacity of the barons. Following the successful sale of sheriff positions in 1194, John introduced a fresh wave of appointments, enabling the new appointees to recoup their investments through escalated fines and penalties, notably within the forest areas. He also extended Richard's practice of imposing higher fees on widows opting to remain unmarried. Moreover, John persisted in the practice of selling charters for establishing new towns, including",
        "During the Enlightenment era, a variety of new concepts regarding religion emerged, such as Deism and discussions around atheism. Deism, as described by Thomas Paine, involves a straightforward faith in God as the Creator, with no reliance on religious texts or miracles. Instead, Deists depend on personal reasoning to shape their beliefs, a notion that resonated well with many intellectuals of that period. While atheism was a topic of debate, it had few advocates. Wilson and Reill point out that most enlightened thinkers critical of Christianity were not true atheists but rather inclined towards skepticism, deism, vitalism, or pantheism. Some, influenced by Pierre Bayle, argued that atheists could still possess moral virtues. Figures like Voltaire believed that without a belief in a punitive deity, the social moral fabric would weaken, as atheists were not bound by a higher authority or moral code.",
        "Sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation by strengthening neural connections in the brain, enhancing its ability to stabilize and retain memories. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sleep significantly improves memory retention through active consolidation. Specifically, system consolidation occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), where memories are reactivated and transferred to long-term storage. This process involves qualitative changes to memories and replays of daily events by the hippocampus to the neocortex. Inadequate sleep can weaken neural connections, hindering learning and memory retention.",
        "Memory is often perceived as a static recording device, but in reality, it is far more complex. The molecular processes involved in memory formation and retention are intricate, consisting of different stages that can span from mere seconds to an entire lifetime. Studies have shown that memories are not exact replicas of events but are actively constructed during encoding and retrieval. For instance, a famous experiment by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer in 1974 demonstrated how the wording of a question could significantly influence participants' recollection of an event. Participants who were asked about the speed of cars \"smashing\" into each other reported higher speeds compared to those asked about cars \"hitting\" each other. Moreover, when questioned a week later about seeing broken glass in the video, those who were primed with the word \"smashed\" were more likely to falsely remember the detail.",
        "Zhejiang in ancient times was not under the predominant influence of the Shang civilization in the second millennium BC. It was inhabited by various groups collectively referred to as the Hundred Yue, such as the Dongyue and the Ouyue. The emergence of the kingdom of Yue is documented in records from the Spring and Autumn Period, placing it in the northern region of Zhejiang. Historical sources mention that the rulers of Yue were believed to be descendants of Yu the Great, the founder of the Shang dynasty. The Baiyue and the kingdom of Yue had distinctive cultural and historical backgrounds, setting them apart from the northern and central Chinese kingdoms whose histories were meticulously recorded from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Qin dynasty. The Song of the Yue Boatman, also known as \"越人歌,\" is a testament to this unique cultural heritage.",
        "Protestantism also expanded from Germany to France, where adherents were referred to as Huguenots. Despite facing severe persecution, the Reformed movement gained ground in various parts of the country, attracting those disillusioned by the entrenched attitudes of the Catholic hierarchy. French Protestantism evolved into a movement with significant political overtones, especially following the conversions of aristocrats in the 1550s. This transformation set the stage for a series of conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion, which escalated after the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. The era was marked by brutality and horror, culminating in the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in August 1572, where Roman Catholic forces massacred between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots in France.",
        "In contrast to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is highly organized. Each NFL team participates in four pre-season exhibition games annually - two home games and two away games. Additionally, two teams engage in a fifth game, known as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. Typically taking place in August, these exhibition games serve the purpose of assisting coaches in reducing the roster size from 90 players during the offseason to 53 players for the regular season. Although the scheduling of preseason games is less stringent compared to the regular season, several restrictions and customs govern the selection of opponents, as well as the days and timings of the games. Similar to practices in baseball and hockey, split-squad games are also observed, where a team playing two games on the same day divides its players into two squads.",
        "During the early and mid-1980s, Libya faced economic challenges as its annual oil revenues plummeted from $21 billion in 1982 to $5.4 billion in 1986. To address these issues, the country shifted its focus to irrigation projects, initiating the construction of the Great Man-Made River, also known as \"Gaddafi's Pet Project,\" in 1983. Despite aiming for completion by the end of the decade, the project was still unfinished as the 21st century began. Concurrently, Libya increased military spending while reducing other administrative budgets. The country's involvement in neighboring Chad's civil war saw it supporting the FROLINAT militia. In 1980, Libya re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government, proposing a political merger in 1981 which was rejected by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Following the OAU's call for a Libyan withdrawal in November 1981, Libya initially complied but later re-engaged in the conflict, leading to clashes with French forces supporting the southern Chadian forces.",
        "In Seoul, South Korea, the event took place on April 27, in the same city that hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics. Torchbearers Choi Seung-kook and Park Won-sun opted out of participating to express their disapproval of the Chinese government's actions in Tibet. To ensure security along the 24-kilometre route starting at Olympic Park, where the 1988 Summer Games were held, over 8,000 riot police were stationed. During the torch relay, clashes ensued between Chinese students and protesters, resulting in the hurling of objects and physical altercations. A North Korean defector, whose brother was captured and executed after defecting to China, tried to self-immolate in protest of China's treatment of North Korean refugees. Despite dousing himself in gasoline, the police intervened promptly, preventing any harm. Additionally, two other demonstrators made unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the torch procession. Tensions escalated at the relay's onset when around 500 Chinese supporters clashed with a group of individuals, leading to a heated confrontation.",
        "The interpretations of separation by Jefferson and James Madison have sparked ongoing discussions. Jefferson declined to issue Thanksgiving Proclamations from Congress during his presidency but did release a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Virginia's Governor. While President, Madison issued four religious proclamations and vetoed two bills for first amendment violations. Despite this, both Jefferson and Madison attended religious services at the Capitol. Madison argued for the freedom of religion from both societal and legislative authority before the Constitution's ratification. Post-presidency, Madison advocated for a complete separation of church and state, emphasizing the strict division outlined in the U.S. Constitution.",
        "Virgil's works revolutionized Latin poetry upon their publication, quickly becoming fundamental texts in Roman education. Poets who came after often alluded to Virgil's writings to add depth to their own work. For example, in Amores 1.1.1–2, Ovid parodied the opening lines of the Aeneid, and in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, he condensed the Aeneas narrative into what is known as the \"mini-Aeneid,\" showcasing a notable post-Virgilian response to epic poetry. Conversely, Lucan's Bellum Civile is seen as an anti-Virgilian epic, rejecting divine intervention, focusing on historical events, and straying from traditional Virgilian epic conventions. Statius, in his 12-book epic Thebaid, closely engages with Virgil's poetry, advising in the epilogue to not surpass the divine Aeneid but rather to honor its influence.",
        "In his book \"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice,\" Terry Eastland discusses the rationale behind affirmative action, highlighting two main arguments: addressing past discrimination and promoting diversity. Eastland argues that the unintended consequence of affirmative action has been the allocation of benefits to middle-class minorities who may not necessarily require them. Furthermore, she suggests that affirmative action can lead to a sense of self-doubt and entitlement among minorities due to the associated stigma. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a risky strategy with sporadic success and contends that its absence would foster a more equitable competitive environment. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, in his work \"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study,\" points out the adverse effects of affirmative action policies, such as incentivizing non-preferred groups to identify as preferred groups to gain advantages.",
        "The most significant military conflict that the United States became involved in during this period was the War of 1812. Due to Britain's involvement in a major war with France led by Napoleon, it aimed to obstruct American trade with France. Despite American efforts to stay neutral and engage in international trade, Britain interfered by halting trade and impressing American sailors into their Royal Navy, leading to strong objections. Furthermore, Britain supported a Native American uprising in the American Midwest in an attempt to establish an Indian territory to impede American expansion. Consequently, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, marking its first official declaration of war. Recognizing the challenges of facing the powerful Royal Navy, the U.S. strategy involved launching an invasion of British Canada, hoping to gain captured territories for negotiation purposes. However, the Canadian invasion resulted in failure, while simultaneous conflicts with Native American tribes in the western regions such as Tecumseh's War and the Creek War were relatively more successful. Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, Britain dispatched seasoned armies to invade.",
        "In the context of these peripheral territories, the Qing dynasty upheld its imperial authority, portraying the emperor as the Mongol khan, a supporter of Tibetan Buddhism, and a guardian of Muslims. Nevertheless, a shift in Qing policy occurred when Xinjiang province was established in 1884. Amid the geopolitical maneuvering of The Great Game period, Yaqub Beg seized control of Xinjiang from Central Asia during the Dungan rebellion in northwestern China, aided by the British Empire, establishing himself as the ruler of Kashgaria. The Qing administration dispatched troops to quash Yaqub Beg's rule, reclaiming Xinjiang and imposing the political framework of mainland China on the region. The Kumul Khanate, originally aligned with the Qing after assisting in defeating the Zunghars in 1757, retained its autonomy following Xinjiang's provincial designation until the collapse of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. In the early 20th century, a British military expedition entered Tibet, compelling the Tibetans to comply with their demands.",
        "BYU boasts 21 NCAA varsity teams, with nineteen previously competing mainly in the Mountain West Conference from 1999 until the school's departure in 2011. Preceding this, BYU teams were part of the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are known as the \"Cougars,\" with Cosmo the Cougar serving as the school's mascot since 1953. The Cougar Fight Song stands as the school's anthem. Notably, many BYU players embark on two-year full-time missions (men at 18, women at 19), resulting in older athletes on average compared to other schools. NCAA regulations permit students to undertake missions without affecting their eligibility period. Despite some controversy, this practice is widely seen as offering no notable advantage to the school, given the lack of athletic and minimal physical training during missions. Additionally, BYU has drawn attention from sports networks for its stance on declining to participate in games on certain occasions.",
        "John viewed the interdict as a severe act, akin to a declaration of war by the Pope. In response, he tried to retaliate against Innocent directly and create divisions among English clergy, distinguishing those who supported him from those who stood by the Roman authorities. John confiscated the lands of clergy who refused to perform services and those connected to Innocent. He also detained the illegal partners of many churchmen, releasing them only after fines were paid. Additionally, he took over the properties of church members who had left England and offered protection to loyal clergy. Some institutions managed to negotiate terms for handling their lands and retaining profits. By 1209, the conflict remained unresolved, leading Innocent to threaten excommunication if John did not accept Langton's appointment. Despite this warning, Innocent's efforts were futile.",

In January 1942, Chinese troops achieved a significant victory at Changsha, marking the first Allied triumph over Japan. Following the Doolittle Raid, Japanese forces launched a large-scale operation through Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces in China, recognized as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, aiming to locate the surviving American airmen, punish the Chinese who assisted them, and dismantle air bases. This offensive commenced on 15 May 1942, involving 40 infantry battalions and 15–16 artillery battalions, but was successfully thwarted by Chinese forces by September. Throughout this campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army left a path of destruction and havoc in its wake.",
        "CNET's review of the new Super Slim PlayStation 3 gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, deeming it \"Excellent.\" The review praised the compact design that maintains the features of its predecessors, such as a robust gaming library and various streaming services. However, CNET criticized the perceived \"cheap\" quality of the design and disc-loader, likening the disc-loading experience to using outdated credit card imprinters. The review highlighted the absence of autoloading disc trays as a drawback, suggesting that the shift to manual loading may have been a cost-saving measure that detracts from user convenience. Additionally, CNET noted that despite the enhanced features of the Super Slim model, such as a smaller size and larger hard drive, the higher price compared to the Slim model may not justify these upgrades, especially since the Slim model's hard drive is easily replaceable.",
        "Dorgon's controversial decree in July 1645, known as the \"haircutting order,\" mandated that mature Han Chinese males shave the front of their heads and style the remaining hair into the queue, a hairstyle commonly sported by Manchu men, under the threat of death. The decree was famously summarized as: \"To keep your hair, you lose your head; To keep your head, you cut your hair.\" For the Manchus, this regulation served as a loyalty test and a means of identifying allies and adversaries. Yet, for the Han Chinese, it symbolized a degrading imposition of Qing supremacy that contradicted their deep-rooted Confucian principles. According to the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing), which emphasized the sanctity of one's body and hair as gifts from parents, any harm to them was prohibited. During the Ming dynasty, adult males refrained from cutting their hair and instead opted for",
        "Boundaries can be perceived as either inclusive or exclusive by others, depending on their interpretation. For instance, an exclusive boundary is established when an individual adopts a marker that sets limitations on the behavior of others. Conversely, an inclusive boundary is formed by utilizing a marker that others are willing and able to identify with. Nonetheless, an inclusive boundary will also restrict the individuals it includes by confining their participation within other boundaries. For instance, when a newcomer in a multilingual setting uses a specific language, some may comprehend it while others may not. Those who do not understand the language might view the newcomer's choice as a neutral display of identity or as an exclusive boundary meant to separate them from her.",
        "During the 78 rpm era, manufacturers experimented with innovative materials to create flexible or \"unbreakable\" records. In the UK, Nicole records were introduced in 1904, constructed from celluloid or similar substances on a cardboard core, but they were plagued by excessive surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records launched the \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" in 1907, featuring a flexible fiber core for reduced noise, yet its success hinged on using special gold-plated Marconi Needles and ultimately failed to gain traction. Plastic records like the German Phonycord and British Filmophone and Goodson records emerged around 1930 but had short lifespans. Notably, the French Pathé Cellodiscs, crafted from a thin black plastic, bore a striking resemblance to the conventional records of the time.",
        "In 1919, post the Treaty of Versailles, the city was returned to France without a plebiscite, aligning with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's \"Fourteen Points.\" The transfer was officially dated back to Armistice Day. The likelihood of a favorable outcome for France in a Strasbourg referendum seems uncertain, given that the political factions advocating for an independent Alsace or union with France held a minor share of votes in both the previous Reichstag and local elections. Pro-French Alsatian autonomists had garnered significant support in rural areas and other municipalities following the region's annexation by Germany in 1871. The movement commenced during the initial Reichstag election, leading to the election of representatives known as \"les députés protestataires.\" These representatives remained the sole Alsatian deputies in the German government until Bismarck's resignation in 1890.",
        "While new kingdoms emerged in Western Europe, the Eastern Roman Empire stayed intact and underwent an economic resurgence until the early 7th century. The eastern part faced fewer invasions, mostly concentrated in the Balkans, and enjoyed prolonged peace with Persia throughout the 5th century. This period was characterized by a closer relationship between the state and the Christian Church, where doctrinal issues played a significant role in eastern politics, unlike in Western Europe. A milestone in legal progress was the codification of Roman law, starting with the completion of the Theodosian Code in 438. Emperor Justinian (527–565) spearheaded another significant compilation known as the Corpus Juris Civilis, alongside overseeing the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Under the leadership of Belisarius (d. 565), Justinian also orchestrated the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths. However, the conquest of Italy remained incomplete due to a severe plague outbreak in 542, diverting the focus of Justinian's reign towards defensive strategies.",
        "Upon its release in the US, Nintendo deliberately crafted a unique design for the NES to set it apart from other gaming consoles. This decision aimed to distance the product from the negative reputation associated with game consoles following the 1983 video game crash. To achieve this, Nintendo disguised the cartridge slot as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, resembling a VCR's front-loading mechanism. Although this innovative connector worked effectively with clean components, over time, the repeated insertion and removal of cartridges led to wear and tear on the pins, compromising the ZIF's purported zero insertion force functionality.",
        "Protestants were pivotal in championing religious freedom, with the concept of freedom of conscience emerging as a top priority across theological, philosophical, and political realms following Luther's steadfast defense of his beliefs at the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Worms (1521). Luther's belief in faith as a voluntary act guided by the Holy Spirit, rather than something that could be imposed, set the stage for persecuted groups like the Anabaptists and Huguenots to advocate for freedom of conscience and practice church-state separation. In the early 17th century, influential Baptists such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys penned defenses of religious freedom, shaping the views of later thinkers like John Milton and John Locke on tolerance. Guided by leaders such as Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania blended democratic principles with religious freedom, providing refuge for marginalized groups, including Jews. This commitment to religious freedom is reflected in foundational American documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.",
        "Birds have a highly effective method of oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream, with a surface area to gas exchange volume ratio ten times greater than that of mammals. This results in a higher concentration of blood in the capillaries per lung volume unit compared to mammals. Arteries are constructed with thick elastic muscles to endure the pressure from ventricular constriction, gradually stiffening as they extend away from the heart. The blood is propelled through the arteries, which experience vasoconstriction, and then into arterioles that serve as a distribution system delivering primarily oxygen and nutrients to all body tissues. As the arterioles branch out from the heart towards individual organs and tissues, they further divide to enhance surface area and slow down blood flow. Blood flows through the arterioles into capillaries where gas exchange takes place. Capillaries are arranged into capillary beds within tissues.",
        "The men's basketball team boasts a remarkable record of over 1,600 victories, a feat achieved by only 12 other schools, along with 28 appearances in the NCAA tournaments. Notably, former player Austin Carr set a tournament record by scoring 61 points in a single game. While the team has never clinched an NCAA Tournament title, they were honored as national champions twice by the Helms Athletic Foundation. The team is renowned for causing major upsets, notably ending UCLA's historic 88-game winning streak in 1974. In total, they have defeated nine number-one ranked teams, with only UCLA surpassing this record with 10 victories. Competing at the newly refurbished Purcell Pavilion within the Edmund P. Joyce Center since the 2009–2010 season, the team is under the leadership of coach Mike Brey, as of the 2014–15 season.",
        "A century following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Pierre Belon documented in his publication Observations in 1553 that pissasphalto, a compound of pitch and bitumen, was employed in Dubrovnik for ship caulking. The substance was then traded to Venice, where it was available for purchase by the public. The application of asphalt in France was referenced in an 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine. A brochure from 1621, authored by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys,\" reported the discovery of abundant asphaltum near Neufchatel. The author suggested various uses for the material, including constructing airtight granaries and safeguarding waterways in Paris from contamination with the help of arches.",
        "Established in 1852, Marshall Field & Company was a prominent department store situated on Chicago's State Street in the Midwest. It attracted affluent clientele who would travel by train from various regions to shop and stay at nearby hotels. Over time, it expanded into a well-known chain before rebranding as Macy's on 9 September 2006. Marshall Field's was known for its exceptional customer service, setting a benchmark for other department stores. The store introduced the popular Frango mints brand, closely associated with both Marshall Field's and Chicago, originally from the now-defunct Frederick & Nelson Department store. Marshall Field's was also a pioneer in various retail innovations, including establishing the first European buying office in Manchester, England, launching the first bridal registry, and offering complimentary personal shopping services at all its locations until its closure.",
        "Certain street trams, also known as streetcars, utilized a method called conduit third-rail current collection, where the third rail was positioned below street level. The tram accessed the current via a plough (plow in the U.S.) that connected through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, particularly in Washington, D.C., and Manhattan, this approach was adopted in parts of the former streetcar systems to eliminate the need for visible wires and poles associated with electric traction. Remnants of this system can still be observed on tracks leading to the Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London and on sections of P and Q Streets in the Georgetown neighborhood.",
        "According to the 2010 Census, the Asian American population in New York City exceeds one million, surpassing the combined figures of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York City boasts the largest Asian population among all U.S. cities. Queens, one of the boroughs of New York City, is known for having the most extensive Asian American and Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) communities in the United States, making it one of the most culturally diverse urban regions globally. The Chinese demographic is the fastest-growing nationality in New York State, with various satellite Chinatowns emerging in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens, and extending into suburban Nassau County on Long Island. New York City and its neighboring areas remain popular destinations for Chinese immigrants, contributing to the ongoing influx of Chinese residents in the region. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City's population consisted of Chinese individuals.",
        "In their 2003 paper titled \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races,\" Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles extensively criticize the use of FST in studying human populations. They argue that the commonly cited 85% figure is deceptive as it suggests that all human populations encompass 85% of total genetic diversity on average. According to Long and Kittles, this oversimplification fails to account for the intricate interrelationships among human groups throughout history. They propose a more accurate representation that acknowledges some human populations serving as ancestors to others. For instance, based on the recent African origin theory, African populations are considered ancestral to all non-African populations, making non-African groups subsets derived from a limited, non-representative portion of the total genetic pool.",
        "Libya's economy underwent a surge in privatization despite the rejection of socialist policies that advocated for nationalized industries as outlined in The Green Book. The government officials claimed they were pursuing \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi supported these changes and in a speech in March 2003, he called for extensive privatization. By 2003, a significant portion of the oil industry had been sold to private companies. Subsequently, in 2004, Libya saw a substantial increase in direct foreign investments amounting to $40 billion, marking a sixfold rise from the previous year. The reforms faced resistance from various sectors of the Libyan population, leading to public protests. In March 2006, hard-line revolutionaries gained control of the GPC cabinet, slowing down the pace of reforms but not stopping them entirely. Plans were unveiled in 2010 to privatize half of Libya’s economy within the next decade, without any concurrent political liberalization as Gaddafi continued to maintain significant authority. However, in March 2010, the government delegated more powers to municipal councils. The increasing privatization efforts were met with",
        "The commencement of military operations took place in September 1806. In a significant communication to Marshal Soult outlining the strategy for the campaign, Napoleon expounded on the key tenets of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the term le bataillon-carré ('square battalion'). Under the bataillon-carré formation, the diverse corps of the Grande Armée would advance in unison in close proximity to one another. This approach enabled swift support from other corps in case of an attack on any individual unit. Leading an invasion of Prussia with 180,000 soldiers, Napoleon swiftly advanced along the right bank of the River Saale. Consistent with past campaigns, his primary aim was to eliminate one adversary before additional reinforcements could alter the course of the conflict. Upon receiving intelligence on the Prussian forces' location, the French forces turned westward and crossed the Saale with superior strength. At the battles of Jena and Auerstedt on 14 October, the French decisively triumphed over the Prussian army.",
        "Many historians agree that the removal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish background was not favored by Nazi Germany, was a significant factor in the timing of German rapprochement. Stalin promptly instructed Molotov to remove Jews from the ministry. Litvinov's efforts to form an anti-fascist coalition, his ties to collective security with France and Britain, and his relatively pro-Western stance within the Kremlin indicated a potential shift towards Germany. Molotov's appointment signaled to Germany that the USSR was willing to engage in negotiations, and to France and Britain, it hinted at a possible opening for talks with Germany. One British official noted Litvinov's departure as a loss of a skilled mediator, contrasting it with Molotov's more ideologically driven approach. Carr suggested that the Soviet Union's decision to replace Litvinov with Molotov signaled a shift in its foreign policy approach.",
        "Critics described Gaddafi as despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain, and unintelligent, while western governments and media painted him as a brutal dictator ruling over an oppressed population. During the Reagan era, the US considered him their top enemy, with Reagan famously branding him as the \"crazed leader of the Middle East.\" Detractors claimed that under Gaddafi's rule, Libyans lived in constant fear due to extensive government monitoring. Western analysts often referred to Gaddafi's Libya as a dictatorship, where human rights violations were rampant. Critics pointed out numerous instances of unfair trials, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political dissidents, notably in the notorious Abu Salim prison, including a reported massacre on June 29, 1996, where Human Rights Watch estimated that hundreds were affected.",
        "A genuine predator is typically recognized as an organism that hunts and consumes another living being. Unlike various predator types that harm their prey differently, this category causes the death of their prey. Predators exhibit different hunting strategies, such as active pursuit or patient ambush techniques. They can either dismantle and consume large prey, like jaguars or humans, or swallow smaller prey whole, like bottlenose dolphins eating fish or snakes, ducks, or storks ingesting frogs. Certain animals, like domestic cats and dogs, adjust their predatory behavior based on the situation; they might swallow a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predators use venom to immobilize their prey before consuming it, ensuring a successful kill.",
        "The Israelites experienced periods of political independence twice in ancient times, initially under the governance of the Biblical judges and later during the United Monarchy era. Following the collapse of the United Monarchy, the territory was split into Israel and Judah, with the term \"Jew\" deriving from the Roman term \"Judean,\" referring to inhabitants of the southern kingdom of Judah. This transition from \"Israelites\" to \"Jews\" is explicitly noted in the Book of Esther, dated to the 4th century BCE. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, laid siege to Jerusalem, resulting in the destruction of the First Temple and the exile of Judah's elite citizens. By 586 BC, Judah lost its independence as a kingdom, leaving the remaining Jewish population stateless. The Babylonian exile came to an end in 539 BCE when the Achaemenid Empire overthrew Babylon, with Cyrus the Great playing a pivotal role in these events.",
        "Van Praag suggests that the Ming court's diplomatic missions to Tibet were primarily motivated by the urgent requirement for horses. However, Wang and Nyima counter this by asserting that these missions did not constitute diplomacy, as Tibetan territories were effectively under Ming control, with Tibetan leaders serving as Ming officials. They claim that the collection of horses from Tibet was akin to a mandatory tax, indicating Tibetan involvement in internal rather than external political matters. Sperling adds that the Ming also procured horses from the Kham region while engaging in conflicts with Tibetan tribes in Amdo and hosting Tibetan delegations in Nanjing. He contends that the visits of Tibetan lamas to the Ming court were largely aimed at facilitating commercial exchanges between the lamas' affluent retinues and Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš notes that although the Ming adopted a hands-off approach towards Tibet and restricted the size of Tibetan delegations, the Tibetans sought to preserve a tributary bond with the Ming due to the benefits of imperial favor.",
        "The Guangxu Emperor passed away on November 14, 1908. The following day, on November 15, 1908, Cixi also passed away. Speculation arose claiming that either she or Yuan Shikai instructed loyal eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor. Nearly a hundred years later, an examination revealed toxic levels of arsenic in his remains. Puyi, Zaifeng's eldest son and Prince Chun's nephew, who was related to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was designated as his successor at the tender age of two, leading to Zaifeng assuming the role of regent. Subsequently, General Yuan Shikai was stripped of his influential positions. In April 1911, Zaifeng established a cabinet featuring two vice-premiers. Despite this setup, the contemporaries also dubbed this cabinet as \"The Royal Cabinet\" due to the fact that, among the thirteen members, five were closely connected to the royal family.",
        "Plumage is regularly shed by birds; the standard plumage a bird exhibits after shedding post-breeding is referred to as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes classification—\"basic\" plumage; plumages displayed during breeding or variations of the basic plumage are categorized as \"alternate\" plumages in the Humphrey-Parkes system. While most species undergo an annual moult, some may experience two moults per year, with certain large birds of prey moulting only once every few years. Moulting sequences vary among species. In perching birds, replacement of flight feathers occurs gradually, starting with the innermost primary feather. As the fifth or sixth primary feather is regrown, the outermost tertiaries are shed. Following the moult of the innermost tertiaries, the replacement of secondaries begins from the innermost and progresses outwards (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are shed concurrently with the primary feathers they overlap. Only a few species, like",
        "Agricultural societies emerged in southeastern Europe during the 7th millennium BC, as evidenced by the discovery of one of Europe's earliest farming sites in Vashtëmi, southeastern Albania, dating back to 6,500 BC. The presence of anthropomorphic figurines dates back to 6000 BC in the Balkans and around 5800 BC in Central Europe (La Hoguette). The Sesklo culture in Thessaly was among the initial cultural complexes in the region, which later gave rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča cultures in the Balkans. The Neolithic traditions spread to northwestern Europe by approximately 4500 BC through a mix of cultural diffusion and migration. The Vinča culture is credited with possibly developing the earliest form of writing, known as the Vinča signs, although archaeologist Shan Winn suggests that they likely functioned as pictograms and ideograms rather than a fully developed writing system.",
        "Numerous rationales have been put forth to explain Yale University's involvement in national elections post-Vietnam War. Many sources highlight the long-standing culture of campus activism at Yale dating back to the 1960s and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on several prospective candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes this trend to the university's commitment to nurturing \"a breeding ground for future leaders,\" a core institutional objective initiated during the leadership of former Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Former Yale College dean and current Duke University President, Richard H. Brodhead, emphasized the importance placed on community engagement in Yale's admissions process and the robust tradition of volunteer work at the university. Noted Yale historian Gaddis Smith underscores the prevalent ethos of organized engagement throughout Yale's 20th-century history, citing examples such as John Kerry leading the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki heading the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman overseeing the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia also highlights this historical aspect.",

In comparison to other Canadian cities, St. John's has relatively mild winter temperatures and experiences the mildest winter among all Canadian cities outside of British Columbia. The city receives frequent and heavy precipitation throughout the year. While summer is generally drier with sporadic thunderstorms, the wettest period spans from October to January, with December being the wettest month, receiving an average of nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation. This winter precipitation peak is uncommon for humid continental climates, which typically see high precipitation in late spring or early summer.",
        "In Paris, the torch relay on April 7 commenced at the Eiffel Tower's first level and concluded at the Stade Charléty, covering a shortened distance of 28 km due to protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists. Chinese officials requested the alteration following disruptions by activists aiming to impede or stop the procession. A town hall ceremony was canceled at the Chinese authorities' behest, and the torch completed the relay via bus instead of by athletes, per their request. Paris City officials had intended to peacefully protest upon the torch's arrival in the French capital and had planned to display a banner stating \"Paris defends human rights throughout.\"",
        "Surveys conducted in Europe and the United States reveal that green is widely associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. Although in these regions it can also be linked to negative connotations such as death, sickness, or the devil, in China, green symbolizes fertility and happiness. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, clothing color denoted social status, with green attire indicating merchants, bankers, and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. Notably, the Mona Lisa depicted by Leonardo da Vinci dons green attire, indicating her non-noble origins. Additionally, green benches in the British House of Commons contrast with the red ones in the House of Lords. Symbolically, green represents safety and permission, akin to a green light signaling permission to proceed or a green card granting permanent residence.",
        "During that period, Libya re-emerged onto the global stage, initiating confidential discussions with the British government in 1999 to normalize diplomatic ties. By 2001, Gaddafi publicly denounced the September 11 attacks orchestrated by al-Qaeda, expressing solidarity with the victims and advocating for Libyan participation in the War on Terror against extremist Islamism. Concurrently, his administration continued to suppress domestic Islamist movements, even as Gaddafi promoted the broader implementation of sharia law. Libya further solidified its partnerships with China and North Korea, hosting Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. In a response influenced by the Iraq War, Libya formally renounced its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in December 2003, dismantling both its chemical and nuclear arms programs. This decision led to enhanced relations with the United States, culminating in a meeting between UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gaddafi in the Libyan desert in March 2004. The subsequent month, Gaddafi made a journey to the European Union (EU) headquarters in Brussels, symbolizing the enhanced cooperation between Libya and the EU.",
        "Constantius, in 356, commanded Liberius to go into exile, granting him a three-day deadline for compliance. Liberius was directed to be banished to Beroea in Thrace and was offered valuable gifts if he accepted the Arian stance, which he declined. He rejected five hundred gold pieces sent to cover his expenses, suggesting they be given to his flatterers. He also refused a similar gift from the empress, advising the messenger to embrace Christianity and refrain from persecuting the Church. Despite attempts to leave the presents in the Church, Liberius rejected them. Subsequently, Constantius summoned him to Milan under tight security. In a documented meeting with Theodoret, Liberius fearlessly asserted that Athanasius had been cleared at Sardica, branding his accusers as slanderers and deceivers, and condemning the injustice.",

        "The Montana Territory came into existence on April 26, 1864, following the enactment of the Organic Act by the U.S. Even before its official establishment, schools began to emerge in the region as families began to settle in. The initial schools were subscription-based and often held in the teacher's residence. The earliest documented formal school was established at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot valley in 1862, catering to both Indian children and the offspring of Fort Owen staff. The school term commenced in early winter and concluded on February 28, with instruction provided by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was founded by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, charging students $1.75 per week. In 1864, the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly held its inaugural session, during which the first legislature granted counties the authority to impose taxes to support schools, thus laying the groundwork for public education.",
        "Self-esteem, a crucial element in shaping one's identity, refers to an individual's perceptions and emotions concerning their self-concept. The majority of self-esteem theories emphasize a universal aspiration among individuals of all ages and genders to safeguard, boost, and uphold their self-esteem. Despite common beliefs, there is no concrete evidence indicating a considerable decline in self-esteem throughout adolescence. While \"barometric self-esteem\" can fluctuate swiftly leading to intense distress and anxiety, core self-esteem remains remarkably steady during adolescence. The reliability of all-encompassing self-esteem assessments has been doubted, with suggestions that more precise evaluations could offer deeper insights into the adolescent journey. For girls, sustaining meaningful friendships plays a pivotal role in fostering high self-esteem, with the primary benefit of such relationships being the provision of social and ethical support.",
        "The ancestral demographic composition of Bermuda's population has become less evident over the past four centuries due to ethnic blending. Presently, there is little distinction between black and white Bermudians, except for recent immigrant groups. However, in the 17th century, the scenario was different. During the initial hundred years of colonization, white Protestants of English descent constituted the predominant group, alongside minority white populations of Irish and Scots who were relocated to Bermuda post English invasions of their homelands subsequent to the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking free black individuals from the West Indies, black chattel slaves mainly taken from Spanish and Portuguese vessels by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, mostly from the Algonquian and other tribes along the Atlantic coast, potentially even originating from Mexico. By the 19th century, white Bermudians of English heritage had lost their numerical superiority.",
        "Intel had made attempts to persuade Apple to shift the Macintosh platform to Intel processors without success. Apple determined that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) design would not be competitive against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors in the long run. Although the Motorola 68040 could outperform the Intel 80486 at the same clock speed, the 486 had the advantage of being able to run at much higher clock speeds without overheating issues. Particularly, the clock-doubled i486DX2, operating the CPU logic at double the external bus speed, provided IBM-compatible systems with a significant performance edge over Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to limit the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras while the 486 was widely available to OEMs and DIY enthusiasts further exacerbated the situation. By late 1991, Apple faced challenges as they upgraded their higher-end Macintosh desktop range to the '040 processor.",

        "In order to mitigate the risk of mixing out-of-phase supplies, it is essential to maintain strict isolation between sections of the line that are fed from different feeder stations. This isolation is accomplished through the use of Neutral Sections, also referred to as Phase Breaks, which are typically located at feeder stations and intermittently spaced between them. Although only half of these sections are typically active at any given time, the remaining ones are available to facilitate the shutdown of a feeder station and the transfer of power from neighboring feeder stations. Neutral Sections are typically comprised of a grounded wire segment that is insulated from the adjacent live wires by materials like ceramic beads. This setup allows for a seamless transition of the pantograph between sections. By grounding a section, the occurrence of an arc between live sections is prevented, particularly when there is a voltage disparity between the phases of these sections. This precaution is crucial as protective circuit breakers may struggle to safely interrupt the high current flow in such instances.",
        "Carolingian art aimed at a select audience connected to the court, monasteries, and churches they patronized. It focused on reviving the grandeur and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, while also drawing inspiration from Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art combined elements from Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles with Mediterranean influences, like the book, setting the tone for medieval art. Most surviving religious artworks from the Early Middle Ages consist of illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally crafted for metalwork that has since been lost. Artworks in precious metals were highly esteemed, though many have disappeared. Some notable pieces that have endured include the Cross of Lothair, various reliquaries, and discoveries like the Sutton Hoo burial in Anglo-Saxon England and treasure hoards like Gourdon in Merovingian France, Guarrazar in Visigothic Spain, and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantium.",
        "Cotton cultivation necessitates a lengthy period without frost, abundant sunlight, and a moderate rainfall ranging from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Generally, soils should be quite dense, with nutrient levels not necessarily needing to be exceptional. These conditions are typically found in the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, although a significant amount of today's cotton is grown in regions with lower rainfall that rely on irrigation. Planting for the upcoming year typically commences shortly after the previous autumn's harvest. Although cotton is a perennial plant, it is often grown as an annual to manage pests. In the Northern hemisphere, the spring planting season spans from early February to early June. The region in the United States referred to as the South Plains is a notable area for cotton production.",
        "During Darwin's lifetime, his book underwent numerous translations, which encountered challenges in accurately conveying concepts and metaphors, often influenced by the translator's biases. Darwin himself sent copies to France and Germany, hoping to attract suitable translators who would independently arrange for publication. The renowned naturalist Heinrich Georg Bronn undertook the German translation in 1860, introducing his interpretations and controversial themes that Darwin had intentionally left out. Bronn's version included alterations such as rendering \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\" and incorporating essays on contentious topics like the origin of life and religious implications, reflecting Bronn's commitment to Naturphilosophie. Following Bronn's death in 1862, Julius Victor Carus collaborated closely with Darwin to produce an enhanced translation in 1867.",
        "During the rule of the Capetian dynasty, France gradually extended its control over the nobility, expanding from the Île-de-France to dominate more regions of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. A significant challenge came from the formidable Dukes of Normandy, notably William the Conqueror (duke from 1035 to 1087), who successfully invaded England in 1066 and established a lasting cross-channel empire that persisted in various forms throughout the Middle Ages. The Normans also migrated to Sicily and southern Italy, where Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) arrived in 1059, founding a duchy that evolved into the Kingdom of Sicily. The Angevin dynasty, led by Henry II (reigning from 1154 to 1189) and his son Richard I (reigning from 1189 to 1199), saw the English monarchs governing England and extensive territories in France that were acquired through Henry II's family connections.",

        "After his father Sviatoslav I passed away in 972, Vladimir became prince of Novgorod. However, in 976, he was compelled to seek refuge in Scandinavia following the assassination of his brother Oleg by his half-brother Yaropolk who seized power in Rus. With the support of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, the ruler of Norway, Vladimir marshaled a Viking army and recaptured Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. Noteworthy among his accomplishments as the Prince of Kiev was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', which commenced in 988. According to the Primary Chronicle, Vladimir made the decision to abandon the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs in favor of a new faith. To facilitate this transition, he dispatched some of his trusted advisors and warriors as envoys to various parts of Europe, where they interacted with the Christians.",
        "Galicia was among the regions that saw less combat during the war, as the initial coup attempt succeeded there, firmly placing it under Nationalist control for the war's duration. Despite the absence of major battles, severe repression and casualties occurred. All political parties, labor unions, and Galician nationalist groups like the Seminario de Estudos Galegos were disbanded. The region's autonomy statute was revoked, similar to Catalonia and the Basque provinces after their capture. Over 4,200 individuals, including republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists, were reported by Carlos Fernández Santander to have been unlawfully killed or executed following summary trials. Among the victims were civil governors from all four Galician provinces, the wife of the A Coruña governor, Juana Capdevielle, and mayors like Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela from the Partido Galeguista, as well as prominent socialists.",
        "The majority of fatty acids are considered non-essential since the body can synthesize them as required, typically utilizing energy from other fatty acids. Nonetheless, in humans, a minimum of two fatty acids are classified as essential and necessitate consumption through the diet. Maintaining a proper equilibrium of essential fatty acids, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, is believed to be crucial for overall well-being, although concrete experimental evidence supporting this notion has been challenging to establish. These omega long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are utilized as substrates for a group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins, which play diverse roles within the human body, akin to hormones. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is either derived from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential omega-3 fatty acid, internally within the human body or acquired from marine food sources. EPA acts as a foundational element for the production of series 3 prostaglandins, such as the mildly inflammatory PGE3. Conversely, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an omega-6 fatty acid, acts as a precursor for series 1 prostaglandins.",
        "The collegia appointed public priests who, once chosen, were granted enduring religious authority believed to be derived from the divine. This authority bestowed upon them lifelong influence, privileges, and immunity. As a result, both civil and religious laws imposed limitations on the number and types of religious positions that could be held by an individual and their family. The religious laws were collective and rooted in tradition, shaping political decisions and having the power to override them, making it challenging for personal exploitation. Serving as a priest was considered an esteemed but expensive position, as traditional Roman customs did not provide priests with a salary. Offerings made to the deity belonged to the divine entity, and it was the responsibility of the priest to manage all aspects of the religious practices, even if there was insufficient public funding. This could entail using personal funds to support acolytes and maintain the cult. Attaining a permanent priesthood was often pursued or awarded to individuals who had completed a lifetime of service in the military or politics, ideally in both fields, after achieving their goals in the Cursus honorum.",
        "Beyoncé and Jay Z tied the knot on April 4, 2008, with Beyoncé later announcing their marriage during a video presentation at the Sony Club in Manhattan on October 22, 2008. The revelation coincided with the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, which was officially released on November 18, 2008, in the United States. The album marked the introduction of Beyoncé's alter ego, Sasha Fierce, a persona she developed while working on her hit single \"Crazy in Love\" in 2003. Upon its release, I Am... Sasha Fierce quickly gained popularity, selling 482,000 copies in its first week and debuting at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. The album's standout tracks included the chart-topping \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\" as well as the top-five hits \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo.\" The success of \"Halo\" in particular, which became Beyoncé's longest-running Hot 100 single at the time, contributed to her achieving additional top-ten hits in the US.",
        "While deeply engrossed in writing his pivotal work on Natural Selection, Darwin was interrupted on 18 June 1858 by a shipment from Wallace in the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). The package contained twenty pages outlining an evolutionary concept, prompted by Darwin's previous encouragement, along with a humble request for Darwin to pass it on to Lyell if he found it noteworthy. The proposed mechanism bore striking resemblance to Darwin's own ideas. In correspondence with Lyell, Darwin expressed astonishment at how his predictions had been surpassed and pledged to promptly offer to publish Wallace's work in any journal of his choosing, lamenting that his own originality might be overshadowed. Following discussions with Lyell and Hooker, it was agreed that a collaborative publication combining Wallace's findings with excerpts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society. Consequently, on 1 July 1858, the joint papers titled On the Tendency",

As per a 2012 document presented by GHMC to the World Bank, Hyderabad is home to 1,476 slum areas accommodating a total of 1.7 million residents, with 66% located in 985 slums situated in the central part of the city (which constituted Hyderabad prior to the April 2007 extension), while the remaining 34% reside in 491 suburban settlements. Approximately 22% of the households in these slums had relocated from various regions of India during the final decade of the 20th century, with 63% indicating a residence in the slums spanning over a decade. The overall literacy rate within the slum areas ranges between 60–80%, with female literacy recorded at 52–73%. One-third of the slum settlements have access to basic utilities, while the rest rely on general public services provided by the government. Additionally, there exist 405 government schools, 267 government-assisted schools, and 175 private educational institutions.",
        "Numerous contemporary specialty matches have been created, each with distinct victory conditions. Among these, the ladder match is the most prevalent. In a standard ladder match, participants or teams must scale a ladder to claim a prize suspended above the ring. To triumph, wrestlers must incapacitate their opponents to allow one of them to ascend the ladder and secure the prize. Consequently, the ladder often doubles as a weapon. Prizes may comprise a championship belt, a document guaranteeing a future title opportunity, or any item of significance to the wrestlers involved, such as one entitling the recipient to a cash reward. Another popular specialty contest is the battle royal, where 20-30 wrestlers simultaneously enter the ring, commencing the match.",
        "Following Cassander's demise in 298 BCE, Demetrius, commanding a substantial faithful army and navy, made a move by invading Macedon, claiming the throne in 294 and expanding his rule over Thessaly and much of central Greece from 293 to 291. However, his reign faced a setback in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus launched a dual invasion of Macedon, ultimately dividing the kingdom among themselves. Demetrius regrouped in central Greece with his mercenaries, garnering support in the northern Peloponnese. Despite a failed siege on Athens, he brokered a pact with the Athenians and Ptolemy, allowing him to shift focus to Asia Minor to battle Lysimachus' territories in Ionia, while leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in charge of Greece. Despite initial victories, he capitulated to Seleucus in 285 and eventually met his demise in captivity. Lysimachus, who",
        "Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686) marked a significant milestone as the first notable work presenting scientific theories in a manner accessible to the general public, particularly women interested in science. This publication, aimed at entertaining readers, sparked a series of similar writings that were more reader-friendly compared to the complex academic publications of the time. An example of such work is Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727), which promised a fresh approach with simplified rules and astronomical tables. Voltaire's 1738 publication, Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, served as the first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia, while Émilie du Châtelet's posthumous translation of the Principia in 1756 further contributed to the dissemination of Newton's ideas beyond academic circles.",
        "In 633 AD, Rashidun Arabs launched an invasion of Iran, leading to its conquest by 651 AD. This conquest resulted in a significant shift in the religious beliefs of the Iranian people, as many converted from Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism to Sunni Islam. Consequently, Arabic became the official language, although Persian continued to be used by the general populace and in literature. Iran's transformation into a hub of the Islamic Golden Age saw the emergence of numerous influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. The establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in 1501 further altered the religious landscape, with the conversion of Iranians from Sunni Islam to Twelver Shia Islam, which became the state religion. This conversion marked a pivotal moment in Iranian and Muslim history. Under the rule of Nader Shah from 1736, Iran expanded its territories significantly, reaching a level of power comparable to that of the Sassanid Empire. However, the 19th century saw Iran losing substantial portions of its territory in the Caucasus, which had been integral to its identity for centuries, to Imperial Russia, leading to widespread popular unrest.",
        "A 2002 government report, as reported by the Guardian, reveals that from 1940 to 1979, the Ministry of Defence utilized various regions across the country as a massive laboratory to execute a series of covert germ warfare experiments on civilians. These experiments reportedly included the dispersal of potentially hazardous chemicals and microorganisms over extensive areas without public knowledge. Although the Ministry of Defence asserts that the trials were intended to simulate germ warfare and were harmless, families residing in the vicinity of these experiments have reported instances of birth defects and physical as well as mental disabilities among their children. Consequently, there is a growing demand for a public investigation into these events. The report highlights that millions of individuals were impacted by these experiments, with a specific instance cited from 1961 to 1968 when over a million residents along the south coast of England, spanning from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria such as e.coli and bacillus globigii, a substance that imitates anthrax.",
        "The early 1980s witnessed significant shifts in both personnel and musical direction among established hard rock bands. Tragedies struck with the passing of Bon Scott from AC/DC and John Bonham from Led Zeppelin. Following Bonham's death, Led Zeppelin disbanded, whereas AC/DC persevered, releasing the highly successful album Back in Black (1980) with new frontman Brian Johnson. This record went on to become the fifth top-selling album in the US and the second globally. Concurrently, Black Sabbath parted ways with original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, welcoming Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow, leading to a revitalized sound and an era of innovation, starting with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne launched a solo venture with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring talented guitarist Randy Rhoads. Meanwhile, certain bands like Queen shifted towards a more pop-rock sound, while others continued to uphold their hard rock essence.",
        "Feynman utilized his diagrams depicting interactions among a limited number of particles in spacetime to describe the entirety of physics based on the particles' spins and the extent of coupling of the basic forces. He explored elucidating the strong interactions that govern nucleon scattering through the parton model. This model emerged as a counterpart to the quark model introduced by his colleague Murray Gell-Mann at Caltech. The connection between these models was unclear, with Gell-Mann mockingly labeling Feynman's partons as \"put-ons.\" In the 1960s, physicists viewed quarks merely as a theoretical tool for symmetry calculations, questioning their existence as tangible entities. However, the findings from the Stanford linear accelerator's deep inelastic scattering experiments in the late 1960s, akin to Ernest Rutherford's alpha particle scattering experiment on gold nuclei, began to challenge this perspective.",
        "Beyoncé surprised fans on December 13, 2013, by dropping her self-titled fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any warning or advertising. The album quickly rose to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, marking Beyoncé's fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This achievement established her as the first female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at number one on the chart. The album was well-received by critics and fans alike, achieving significant commercial success by selling one million digital copies worldwide in just six days. The innovative and unexpected release of the album was highlighted by The New York Times as a noteworthy event. Beyoncé's fifth studio album is characterized by electro-R&B sound and delves into deeper, more introspective themes not previously explored in her music, including topics like \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood.\" The track \"Drunk in Love,\" featuring Jay Z, reached the second spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following intense speculation, Beyoncé and Jay Z confirmed their joint On the Run Tour in April 2014, marking their first collaborative tour.",
        "Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were primarily based on traditional medicine. Antimicrobial mixtures for infections date back over 2000 years and were utilized by ancient cultures like the Egyptians and Greeks, who used mold and plant extracts medicinally. Later, the discovery of natural antibacterials from microorganisms in laboratory studies further advanced infection treatment. Louis Pasteur recognized the potential of intervening in bacterial antagonism for therapeutic purposes, coining the term 'antibiosis' in 1877. Jean Paul Vuillemin introduced this term to describe the phenomenon of early antibacterial drugs combating microbial life.",
        "In situations involving three or more parties, it is common for no single party to hold power independently. Instead, parties collaborate to establish coalition governments. This has become a prevalent practice in the political landscape of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s, as well as being the norm in Germany at both national and state levels, and in many local constituencies. Similarly, in Iceland, coalition governments have been the norm since its establishment, typically led by a partnership between the Independence Party and another party, often the Social Democratic Alliance. The political scenario in the Republic of Ireland also reflects this trend, with no party having held sole power since 1989, leading to the formation of numerous coalition governments, predominantly spearheaded by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The flexibility of coalition governments often facilitates smoother political transitions compared to systems dominated by a single party or two major parties.",
        "In 2002, the City of Melbourne aimed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2020 following the acknowledgment of climate change. Similarly, Moreland City Council initiated the Zero Moreland program towards the same goal. Conversely, some urban areas like the City of Glen Eira, notably in 2009, opted not to pursue carbon neutrality. Melbourne's urban sprawl is extensive due to its low-density housing, leading to high car reliance and limited public transportation outside the city center. The city's vegetation primarily comprises non-native European species, often harboring invasive plants and pests like common mynas, feral pigeons, brown rats, European wasps, common starlings, and red foxes. Moreover, outer suburbs, especially in the Yarra Valley and eastern hills, have experienced prolonged periods without rejuvenating fires, resulting in sparse saplings and undergrowth.",

        "The Royal Assent ceremony occurs in the Senate because traditionally, the monarch is not allowed in the House of Commons. On the scheduled day, the Senate's Speaker will announce to the chamber a message from the governor general's secretary, indicating when the viceroy or a deputy will arrive. Following this announcement, the Senate is not permitted to adjourn until after the ceremony. The Speaker then moves to a seat near the throne, accompanied by the Mace Bearer holding the mace, while the governor general assumes the Speaker's chair upon entering. The Speaker instructs the Usher of the Black Rod to call the Members of Parliament, who then follow Black Rod back to the Senate, with the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace from the House of Commons. Inside the Senate, members from the commons stand behind the bar, and Black Rod stands beside the governor general, who nods in approval to signify Royal Assent to the bills presented, excluding appropriations bills.",
        "During the 17th century, Scotland was an independent kingdom until the King of Scotland inherited the English and Irish crowns in 1603. This led to political turmoil, religious conflicts, and wars, including English colonial expansion in Ireland with Scottish and English settlements in Ulster. Tensions rose over religious differences, with the English king's Catholic tolerance policy sparking disputes with parliament. The resulting English Civil War resulted in a republican government in England, while Ireland, mainly Catholic, remained loyal to the king. After defeat, the loyalist Irish nobility lost lands to English commoners in the parliamentary army, leading to the rise of a new Ascendancy class that over time would diminish the influence of the English and Gaelic Irish over the next century.",
        "During the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom underwent a significant evolution and emerged as the Maratha Empire, led by the Peshwas, or prime ministers. In 1737, the Marathas achieved a notable victory over a Mughal army right in Delhi during the Battle of Delhi (1737). They proceeded to engage in military conflicts against various powers including the Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal, and Durrani Empire, with the aim of expanding their territorial holdings. Gordon detailed the strategic approach employed by the Marathas in seizing control of new territories, starting with annual raids, then demanding ransom from local settlements, all while the weakened Mughal Empire still technically held authority, before eventually asserting full dominance over the region. This method was exemplified in their conquest of the Malwa region. The Marathas also established a highly effective system of public administration renowned for its meticulousness, enabling them to generate substantial revenues from districts that had suffered from years of raids, eventually restoring them to their former prosperity.",
        "In 1939, the Bureau initiated the creation of a list for detaining individuals in case of a conflict with Axis nations. The list primarily included Issei community leaders, expanding on a prior Naval Intelligence index focusing on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast. Despite this, numerous German and Italian nationals were also included. Robert Shivers, in charge of the Honolulu office, was granted approval by Hoover to commence detentions on December 7, 1941, amidst the Pearl Harbor bombings. Following the attack, mass arrests and warrantless home searches began shortly after, resulting in over 5,500 Issei men being placed in FBI custody within weeks. President Franklin Roosevelt then issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, allowing for the relocation of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover, however, was against this decision.",
        "The ability of the body to respond to antigens is influenced by factors such as age, the type of antigen, maternal aspects, and the site of antigen presentation. Neonates are considered to have a reduced immune response, as both their innate and adaptive immune reactions are suppressed. After birth, a child's immune system reacts well to protein antigens but less effectively to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Neonates are prone to infections from low-virulence pathogens like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. Neonates have limited opsonic activity and complement cascade activation compared to adults. For instance, the average C3 level in a newborn is around 65% of that in an adult. Phagocytic function is also significantly compromised in newborns due to decreased opsonic activity and reduced expression of integrin and selectin receptors, limiting neutrophils' interaction with endothelial adhesion molecules.",
        "Following independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. was established on 15 April 1948 by consolidating 28 small princely states (comprising feudal princes and zaildars) located in the western Himalayan region, referred to as the Simla Hills States, and four southern hill states of Punjab. This integration was formalized through the issuance of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 in 1950). The State of Bilaspur was incorporated into Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 under the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal Pradesh was designated as a part C state on 26 January 1950 upon the enforcement of the Indian Constitution.",

Originally labeled as \"bums,\" this designation stemmed from their consistent presence at games, mainly day games, leading to assumptions that they were not employed. Many of these enthusiasts were, and continue to be, students from various Chicago colleges like DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and Illinois-Chicago. A long-running Broadway production, featuring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi, was inspired by their camaraderie.",
        "The torch was ignited outside AT&T Park in a park at approximately 1:17 pm PDT (20:17 UTC) and was briefly raised by officials from the American and Chinese Olympic delegations. The start of the relay became chaotic when the initial runner vanished into a warehouse on a pier by the waterfront, remaining there for thirty minutes. The event turned tumultuous with clashes erupting between numerous pro-China demonstrators, reportedly transported by the Chinese Consulate and other advocacy groups, and supporters of the Tibet and Darfur causes. Witnesses described how non-Chinese protesters were overwhelmed and followed by hostile crowds. By around 2 pm PDT (21:00 UTC), the torch reappeared around 3 km (1.9 mi) from the stadium on Van Ness Avenue, a bustling street not part of the planned route.

        "A typical adult soccer game includes two 45-minute halves that run continuously without the clock being stopped when the ball is out of play. A 15-minute halftime break separates the halves, with the conclusion of the game referred to as full-time. The referee is responsible for keeping time during the match and may extend play for stoppages such as substitutions or injuries, a period known as additional time in FIFA guidelines but commonly called stoppage time or injury time. The referee has the discretion to decide the length of stoppage time, and they alone signal the end of the match. In games with a fourth official, the referee indicates the amount of stoppage time to be added towards the end of each half, with the fourth official displaying this information on a board for players and spectators.",
        "Identification of an infectious agent is typically sought when it can contribute to disease treatment, prevention, or a deeper understanding of the illness before effective therapeutic or preventive measures are available. For instance, in the early 1980s, before AZT was introduced for AIDS treatment, disease progression was monitored by analyzing patient blood samples, despite limited treatment options. These investigations into HIV emergence in specific populations helped form hypotheses on virus transmission routes. Understanding transmission facilitated targeted resource allocation to high-risk communities for campaigns reducing new infections. Moreover, precise serological or later genotypic identification of HIV supported theories on its temporal and geographic origins.",
        "Since regaining independence, Estonia has positioned itself as a bridge between the East and the West, actively implementing economic reforms and seeking integration with Western nations. The country's market-oriented changes have elevated its standing among the former COMECON states. Following the economic principles of Milton Friedman, Estonia embraced a flat tax system in 1994, setting a consistent rate of 26% for all income levels. Subsequent reductions saw the personal income tax drop to 24% in January 2005, then to 23% in January 2006, and further to 21% by January 2008. The Estonian government finalized the design of the national euro coins in late 2004, with the euro officially adopted as the official currency on 1 January 2011, albeit delayed due to persistent high inflation rates. Notably, Estonia imposes a Land Value Tax at the state level, with all proceeds allocated to support local municipalities. The specific rate is determined by the Estonian government.",
        "Saint Helena, an island with a total area of 122 km2 (47 sq mi), consists mainly of rugged volcanic terrain, with the last volcanic activities occurring approximately 7 million years ago. The coastal regions are characterized by volcanic rock formations and have a warmer and drier climate compared to the central areas. The highest elevation on the island is Diana's Peak, standing at 818 m (2,684 ft), designated as the island's first national park in 1996. The landscape is dominated by New Zealand flax, a remnant of past industrial activities, while original trees coexist with plantations like the Millennium Forest project initiated in 2002 to replenish the lost Great Wood, now overseen by the Saint Helena National Trust. Upon its discovery, Saint Helena was adorned with unique native flora, including a notable species of cabbage tree. The island's inland regions likely harbored dense tropical forests, with the coastal zones potentially sharing a similarly diverse environment.",
        "In the mid-1980s, there was a resurgence of established bands. Deep Purple reunited after an 8-year break, bringing back the classic Machine Head line-up for the album Perfect Strangers (1984). The album was a commercial success, reaching the top five in the UK and five other countries, and achieving platinum status in the US. Van Halen also experienced a revival with their album Diver Down in 1982 following slower sales of Fair Warning. Their subsequent album, 1984, peaked at number two on the Billboard chart and featured the hit single \"Jump\" which topped the singles chart for several weeks.

        "The political landscape of the United States is predominantly characterized by a two-party system, with the Republican Party representing conservative views and the Democratic Party embodying liberal ideologies. Initially, American politics revolved around the Federalist and Republican parties, which later evolved into the National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. Subsequently, the Whig Party emerged from the National Republicans, while the Democratic Party stemmed from the Democratic Republicans. The Whig Party's dissolution after a mere two decades was triggered by disagreements over slavery, leading abolitionist factions to merge with the newly formed Republican Party. Despite occasional emergence of third parties like the Libertarian Party, they typically struggle to gain significant traction or secure electoral victories. Nonetheless, there have been instances where third parties influenced election outcomes by drawing votes away from the frontrunners, as evidenced by figures like Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election and George Wallace in the 1968 election.",
        "In July 2013, Notre Dame underwent significant changes in its conference affiliations for all sports, except football and fencing, due to a major conference realignment. This transition saw the Irish move from the Big East to the ACC amidst instability in the former. Despite retaining football independence, they agreed to compete in five games annually against ACC opponents. In response to the Big Ten Conference's inclusion of ice hockey in 2013–14, Notre Dame had to seek a new conference for its hockey program, ultimately joining Hockey East following the dissolution of its previous conference, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Furthermore, the ACC, after Notre Dame's accession, revealed plans to introduce fencing as a sponsored sport starting in the 2014–15 academic year. While various theories exist about the origins of the Fighting Irish nickname, the exact reasoning behind its adoption remains uncertain.",
        "Out of the 80 torch-bearers participating in the London event, Sir Steve Redgrave, who initiated the relay, mentioned to the media that he had been urged via email to boycott the event, acknowledging the concerns raised. Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan opted out of carrying the torch, whereas Konnie Huq chose to participate while also expressing criticism towards China. Member of Parliament Norman Baker, an advocate for Tibet, urged all participants to rethink their involvement. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, amidst conflicting pressures, greeted the torch outside 10 Downing Street without physically engaging with it. The torch relay in London was closely guarded by what the BBC termed as \"a moving protective barrier.\" Protests erupted right from the beginning of the event, resulting in approximately thirty-five arrests. A protester in Ladbroke Grove made an attempt to grab the torch from Konnie Huq, leading to a brief scuffle, and in a separate incident, a fire extinguisher was discharged near the torch.

        "Many of the special characters were strategically placed to align with their shifted positions on mechanical typewriters, specifically following the standard established by the Remington No. 2 in 1878. This typewriter introduced the concept of a shift key, leading to the shifted values of 23456789- being represented as \"#$%_&'(). Early mechanical typewriters did not include the characters 0 and 1, substituting them with O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead. However, as 0 and 1 became more prevalent, the 1! and 0) pairs became standardized. In the ASCII character set, !\"#$% were typically placed in the second column, rows 1–5, aligning with the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. Due to the space character occupying the position corresponding to 0, the parentheses could not directly correspond to 9 and 0. This issue was addressed by eliminating the underscore character from the sequence.",
        "The transition to adolescence brings about a rapid shift in one's family dynamics. Initially, children assert themselves assertively but lack significant influence on family matters until early adolescence when parents begin to see them as equals. Adolescents are tasked with gaining more independence while maintaining a nurturing bond with their parents. Puberty often leads to heightened parent-child conflicts and a less cohesive family unit. Disagreements commonly revolve around issues like curfews, clothing choices, and privacy rights, which adolescents previously saw as solely parental decisions. As peer influence grows, conflicts between parents and adolescents escalate, with new influences sometimes conflicting with parental values. The rise of social media has added a new layer to parent-adolescent disagreements. Parents now face concerns regarding the potential risks associated with social media that were not present in previous generations.",
        "Microbiological culture is a vital diagnostic tool for identifying infectious diseases. The process involves providing a growth medium suitable for a specific microorganism. A sample from potentially infected tissue or fluid is then examined to detect the presence of an infectious agent capable of thriving in that medium. Nutrient agar, a solid medium supplying essential carbohydrates, proteins, and water, is commonly used to culture pathogenic bacteria. A single bacterium will develop into a visible colony on the plate's surface, which can be distinct or merge into a \"lawn.\" The characteristics such as size, color, shape, and form of a colony are unique to the bacterial species, its genetic composition, and the growth conditions. Additional components are often included in the culture plate to assist in identification, and certain substances may facilitate the growth of specific bacteria.",

Prior to adopting his stage name, Freddie Mercury (originally known as Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and urged them to explore innovative stage and recording techniques. Mercury officially joined the band in 1970, proposed the new band name \"Queen,\" and embraced his iconic stage persona. Before their debut album in 1973, John Deacon was enlisted into the group. Queen made their UK chart debut with Queen II in 1974, but it was the albums Sheer Heart Attack in 1974 and A Night at the Opera in 1975 that propelled them to global fame. Notably, A Night at the Opera featured the monumental hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which dominated the UK charts for nine weeks and played a pivotal role in popularizing music videos. Their 1977 release, News of the World, included anthems like \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions,\" which have since become synonymous with sporting events.",
        "On 13 March, the Clydebank port located on the upper Clyde River near Glasgow was targeted in a bombing raid, resulting in damage to all but seven of its 12,000 houses. Several other ports also faced attacks during this period, including multiple assaults on Plymouth, and bombings in Belfast, Hull, Cardiff, and Portsmouth. The civilian housing loss rate reached an average of 40,000 people per week dehoused by September 1940. By March 1941, devastating raids on Plymouth and London led to the displacement of 148,000 individuals. Despite the extensive damage inflicted, British ports managed to sustain their operations in support of the war industry, facilitating the passage of supplies from North America. The Royal Navy continued its activities in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth, due to its vulnerable location on the south coast and proximity to German air bases, bore the brunt of the attacks, notably on 10/11 March when 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries, causing severe damage to numerous residential and commercial buildings.",
        "The exact origins of collegiate a cappella are somewhat ambiguous. One of the earliest known collegiate a cappella groups is the Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, dating back to 1873. However, the title of the longest continuously active group is likely held by The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, established in 1909, with Cole Porter once counted among its members. Collegiate a cappella saw significant growth in the 20th century, with notable groups like Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956) emerging over time. Women's a cappella groups also gained popularity, often emerging in response to men's groups, such as the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936) and The Shwiffs of Connecticut College.",
        "Adolescents use communication within their peer groups to delve into their emotions and identity, while honing and assessing their social competencies. Peer groups provide a platform for fostering social skills like empathy, cooperation, and leadership. Adolescents typically gravitate towards peer groups where they recognize similarities with their own traits. By leveraging these bonds, adolescents cultivate self-acceptance. They assimilate the norms and values of the group into their self-image. Through enhancing communication abilities, reflecting on peer interactions, and evaluating personal beliefs, adolescents can openly share their feelings and concerns without the fear of criticism. Peer groups can positively impact individuals, boosting academic drive and performance. Nonetheless, while peers can aid in social growth, they can also impede it. Negative influences from peers, such as promoting substance abuse or delinquent behavior through peer pressure, can occur. Peer pressure vulnerability peaks in early adolescence, typically around age 14, before tapering off. This underscores the dual role peers play in an adolescent's development.",
        "Following a period of internal strife among the Liberals, former Treasurer John Howard and former Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock engaged in a power struggle. This occurred against the backdrop of the Australian economy grappling with the early 1990s recession, resulting in a peak unemployment rate of 11.4% in 1992. Dr. John Hewson spearheaded the opposition's unveiling of the extensive 650-page Fightback! policy document in November 1991. This document outlined a drastic set of \"dry\" economic liberal proposals, such as the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), alterations to Medicare that involved eliminating bulk billing for non-concession holders, capping unemployment benefits at nine months, dismantling awards in industrial relations, a substantial $13 billion tax cut aimed at middle and high-income brackets, $10 billion in government spending reductions, the removal of state payroll taxes, and the privatization of numerous government-owned enterprises. These initiatives marked a departure from the Keynesian economic conservatism that characterized previous Liberal/National Coalition administrations, signaling a significant shift in the party's economic direction.",
        "References to legal matters in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", especially in non-courtroom settings, have captured the interest of legal experts. According to Claudia Durst Johnson, legal scholars have produced a larger body of analytical work in law publications compared to literary scholars in literary journals. The quotation from Charles Lamb, a 19th-century essayist, sets the tone: \"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\" Johnson points out that even in the childhood realm of Scout and Jem, agreements are made through spitting on palms, while Atticus and his children contemplate ethical dilemmas like Bob Ewell's actions of hunting and trapping out of season. Various societal norms are challenged in metaphorical courtrooms, such as the ostracism of Mr. Dolphus Raymond for his relationship with a black woman and their mixed-race children.",
        "In the latter part of 1975, Queen recorded and launched A Night at the Opera, inspired by the renowned Marx Brothers film of the same title. It stood out as the most costly album ever made during that period. Much like its forerunner, the album showcases a variety of musical genres and experiments with stereo effects. Notably, the track \"The Prophet's Song\" presents an eight-minute masterpiece, featuring a canon in the middle segment where uncomplicated phrases are superimposed to produce a rich choral resonance. Moreover, the touching ballad \"Love of My Life,\" written by Mercury, incorporated a harp alongside layered vocal harmonies. The album enjoyed significant success in the UK and achieved triple platinum status in the US. In a survey conducted by Channel 4 in 2004, the British public voted it as the 13th best album of all time. It has also received high rankings in global rankings, being chosen as the 19th greatest album of all time in a worldwide Guinness poll, and the 28th greatest by the Australian public in an ABC poll. A Night at the Opera has consistently been highly acclaimed.",
        "While the concept of Mary's Immaculate Conception was initially prominent among Latin theologians, particularly those from Frankish regions, it gradually gained recognition among Byzantine theologians influenced by Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Even though hymnographers and scholars such as Emperor Justinian I often referred to Mary as \"prepurified\" in their poetic and doctrinal works, a more extensive elaboration on Nazianzen's ideas can be traced back to Sophronius of Jerusalem. Sophronius suggested that the Theotokos was inherently immaculate and only \"purified\" during the Annunciation. He went as far as to imply that John the Baptist, traditionally considered the holiest man born of a woman, was surpassed in holiness by Mary even after his sanctification in the womb. St. John Damascene (d. 749/750) further developed and integrated Sophronius' teachings. In addition to praising Mary's purification at the Annunciation in his writings, John attributed to her the unique ability to \"purify the waters of baptism through her touch.\"",
        "During the torch relay route, various protests took place. Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, led by pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, held inflatable plastic Olympic flames, representing democracy. Their demands included justice for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the establishment of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair), a Legislative Council member, also participated, commending the courage of those speaking out in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy supporters faced verbal attacks from torch supporters, labeling them as \"running dogs\" and \"traitors,\" while expressing love for the Communist Party. Simultaneously, around 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front displayed orange banners advocating for human rights advancements and universal suffrage. Spectators attempted to cover these banners with a large Chinese national flag, questioning the activists' Chinese identity in Mandarin.",
        "Zhejiang's key manufacturing industries include electromechanical, textiles, chemicals, food, and construction materials. The province has adopted a unique development approach known as the \"Zhejiang model,\" focusing on promoting entrepreneurship, supporting small businesses adaptable to market demands, significant public investments in infrastructure, and mass production of affordable goods for both local and international markets. This strategy has propelled Zhejiang to becoming one of China's wealthiest provinces, with the \"Zhejiang spirit\" garnering legendary status. Despite its success, concerns have been raised by some economists regarding the sustainability of this model. They argue that the current approach is inefficient, strains raw materials and public services, and limits the transition of small businesses to more advanced industries.",

She also served as an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign by contributing her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, filmed at the UN, to the cause. In 2013, Beyoncé partnered with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini for the Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign promoting female empowerment, featuring her new music in a video that aired on February 28. A fundraising concert was held on June 1, 2013, in London, where she performed alongside artists like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. Leading up to the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on May 15, 2013.",
        "While Ottoman madaris offered various fields of study like calligraphy, oral, and intellectual sciences, their primary role was as Islamic spiritual learning centers. According to İnalcık, the ultimate aim of knowledge, particularly in spiritual sciences, is the understanding of God. The importance and value of each science were mainly determined by its relationship to religion. İnalcık argues that sciences supporting religion are considered good, while disciplines like astrology are viewed negatively. Despite including subjects like mathematics and logic in their curriculum, madrasas always emphasized their connection to religion. İnalcık notes that Ottoman scholars believed that rejecting logic and mathematics was pointless as they fostered rational thinking and revealed divine truths. Philosophy, as mentioned by İnalcık, was also subject to certain restrictions within the madrasa curriculum.",
        "Inhabited since the Middle Paleolithic period, the region known today as Galicia derived its name from the Celtic Gallaeci, who resided north of the Douro river in the last millennium BC. This area corresponds closely with the territory of the local Iron Age Castro culture. Following the Cantabrian Wars, Galicia became part of the Roman Empire in 19 BC and was later established as a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. The Germanic Suebi founded a kingdom with its capital in Braga in 410, which became part of the Visigothic kingdom in 585. The Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 led to the incorporation of Galicia into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740. Throughout the Middle Ages, Galicia was intermittently governed by its own monarchs, although it was mostly linked to the neighboring kingdom.",
        "Upon its launch, Twilight Princess was hailed as the finest Zelda game to date by a plethora of critics, such as reviewers from 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post. Game Informer even went as far as to describe it as \"so innovative that it competes with top-tier Hollywood productions.\" GamesRadar commended Twilight Princess as \"a title that merits nothing less than the utmost recommendation.\" Cubed3 lauded Twilight Princess as \"the ultimate video game journey.\" While the graphics of Twilight Princess were admired for their artistic style and animation, it was noted that being developed for the GameCube resulted in technical limitations compared to newer consoles. IGN and GameSpy highlighted issues such as blurry textures and low-resolution character models. Nonetheless, Computer and Video Games argued that the game's ambiance surpassed that of any prior Zelda installment, and deemed Twilight Princess's depiction of Hyrule as the most exceptional rendition yet. PALGN specifically praised the game's cinematic sequences, emphasizing that \"the cutscenes are top-notch.\"",
        "The islands are situated at relatively modest elevations, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain being notably low-lying: the islands' lowest point is Holme in Cambridgeshire, reaching an elevation of -2.75 m (-9.02 ft). The Scottish Highlands in the north of Great Britain are characterized by their mountainous terrain, with Ben Nevis standing as the highest peak in the islands at 1,343 m (4,406 ft). Wales and parts of Ireland also feature mountainous regions, though only seven peaks in these areas exceed 1,000 m (3,281 ft) in height. While most lakes on the islands are modest in size, Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland stands out, spanning 150 square miles (390 km2) [citation needed]. Loch Lomond is the largest freshwater body in Great Britain in terms of area, covering 27.5 square miles (71 km2), while Loch Ness holds the title for volume, and Loch Morar is recognized as the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, plunging to a maximum depth of 310 m (1,017 ft).",
        "Despite emerging as victors in the Second World War, Britain and its empire faced significant repercussions from the conflict, both domestically and internationally. The war left Europe, a continent with a long history of global dominance, devastated and under the influence of the United States and the Soviet Union, the new global superpowers. Britain found itself in a dire financial situation, narrowly avoiding bankruptcy in 1946 through a $US 4.33 billion loan (equivalent to US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, a debt that was only fully repaid in 2006. Concurrently, movements advocating for independence from European colonial rule were gaining momentum in various colonies. The geopolitical landscape was further complicated by the escalating Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. While both nations officially opposed European colonialism, American anti-communist sentiments took precedence over anti-imperialism, leading the United States to back the preservation of the British Empire as a buffer against Communist expansion.",
        "Homer identifies the \"Hellenes\" (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small tribe residing in Thessalic Phthia, with their warriors led by Achilleus. According to the Parian Chronicle, Phthia was recognized as the Hellenes' homeland and the term \"Hellenes\" was used in place of the previous name \"Greeks\" (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the progenitor of the Hellenes, was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who governed in the vicinity of Phthia, being the sole survivors following a catastrophic flood. It appears that this myth emerged as Greek tribes began to disperse into distinct regions within Greece, emphasizing their shared ancestry. Aristotle refers to ancient Hellas as an",
        "Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe still posed a significant threat, capable of causing immense destruction. The British were particularly concerned about the potential escalation of submarine and air assaults on their sea routes following the German occupation of Western Europe. The impact of such attacks on Britain's maritime supply lines, especially those vital to convoys from North America passing through Liverpool, could have had far-reaching implications for the outcome of the war if successful. Liverpool, a crucial port for receiving supplies, faced severe damage during the Liverpool Blitz raids. The bombings resulted in the sinking of 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping and damaging another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t). Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison observed a decline in civilian morale, marked by a sense of defeatism. Reports indicated that half of the port's 144 berths were incapacitated, reducing cargo unloading capacity by 75%. The destruction also led to blocked roads and railways, trapping ships in the harbor. The situation reached a peak on 8 May 1941, when 57 ships were lost in the attacks.",
        "The most recent significant construction took place during King George V's rule when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb altered Blore's East Front from 1850 to partially imitate Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. The new primary façade, made of Portland stone, was intended to serve as the setting for the Victoria Memorial, a large statue of Queen Victoria located outside the main gates. George V, who ascended the throne after Edward VII in 1910, had a more solemn demeanor than his father, focusing more on official functions and royal responsibilities rather than extravagant celebrations. He organized a series of exclusive performances showcasing jazz artists like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – marking the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932). This initiative led to the palace being nominated in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival, recognizing it as one of the venues that made a significant contribution to jazz music in the UK.",
        "The temporary peace in Europe gave Napoleon the opportunity to shift his attention towards the French colonies overseas. In Saint-Domingue, which had gained significant political independence during the Revolutionary Wars, Toussaint Louverture had established himself as the de facto ruler by 1801. Napoleon, upon signing the Treaty of Amiens, eyed the chance to regain control of this once prosperous colony. Despite the National Convention's decision to abolish slavery in February 1794, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, Napoleon yielded to British pressure and refrained from ending slavery in colonies where the 1794 decree had not been enforced. This concession, outlined in the Law of 20 May, excluded territories like Guadeloupe and Guyane, where certain military leaders exploited the peace to reintroduce slavery. It's worth noting that the Law of 20 May primarily reinstated the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies rather than slavery itself. Napoleon consequently dispatched General Leclerc on an expedition with the aim of",
        "Greek theologians of Byzantium were well acquainted with the belief in Mary's absolute purity and her exemption from sin from the moment of her inception. St. Gregory Nazianzen was among the first to explore this idea, particularly in relation to the concept of \"purification\" at the circumcision of Jesus and Mary (Luke 2:22). Through his analysis, he suggested that this purification symbolized a state of complete sinlessness that was revealed in a moment of divine grace, as seen, for instance, in Jesus' Baptism. Referring to Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified),\" Gregory proposed that both Jesus and Mary, possessing equally holy human natures, were purified in a similar manner through grace and glory. These teachings on Mary's purification by Gregory were likely influenced by the growing veneration of the Mother of God in Constantinople, particularly around the time of Christmas. The title of \"prepurified\" that Gregory bestowed upon Mary at the Annunciation later gained acceptance.",
        "The state maintained a sense of relative peace in comparison to the rest of the nation due to its strong connection with the United States until 1841. In 1843, the state government foresaw the potential for conflict and took action to fortify defense lines along the Texas border. They dispatched weapons to fully arm the military and implemented measures to enhance the efficiency of the presidios. Subsequently, the state established the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border, consisting of light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small unit comprising 14 men and 42 officials, funded at the cost of 160,603 pesos annually. In the early 1840s, private individuals intervened to halt the passage of commercial supply caravans from the United States; however, due to the distance from major suppliers in central Mexico, the caravans were allowed to proceed in March 1844. In further anticipation of potential conflict, the state legislature decreed on July 11, 1846, the enlistment of 6,000 men.",
        "Napoleon and his soldiers traversed the Swiss Alps into Italy in the spring of 1800 with the intention of catching the Austrian armies off guard, who had reoccupied the region while Napoleon was away in Egypt. Despite the challenging Alpine crossing, the French military advanced into Northern Italy with minimal opposition. Simultaneously, another French army besieged Genoa, diverting the attention of the Austrians stationed there. This diversion facilitated the main French force's operations in the north, led by André Masséna, allowing them to progress with little hindrance. Following a period of scouting, the two forces clashed in the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas held the advantage in numbers with around 30,000 Austrian troops compared to Napoleon's 24,000 soldiers. Initially, the Austrians gained ground with a surprise attack, pushing back the French forces. Melas presumed victory, but the tide of the battle was about to turn.",
        "In Homer's Iliad, the terms Danaans (or Danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (Argives: Αργείοι) are utilized to identify the Greek military forces in opposition to the Trojans. The legend of Danaus, traced back to Egypt, serves as a foundational narrative for Argos. According to the myth, Danaus' daughters, known as the Danaides, were condemned in Tartarus to forever carry water in a leaking jug. This tale reflects an impossible task akin to that of Sisyphus, and the name Danaans could potentially be linked to the Proto-Indo-European root *danu, meaning \"river\". The true origins of the Danaans remain uncertain, with some researchers associating them with the Denyen, a faction of the sea peoples who launched assaults on Egypt under the rule of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). These inscriptions also reference the Weshesh, possibly corresponding to the Achaeans. The Denyen are believed to have resided in the city of Adana located in Cilicia. Additionally, archaeological findings reveal pottery resemblances between the Danaans and other ancient civilizations.",
        "In 1969, Schwarzenegger began a relationship with Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he resided until 1974. Schwarzenegger mentioned Barbara in his 1977 memoir, characterizing her as a stable individual seeking a conventional life, contrasting with his own restless nature and aversion to normalcy. Baker has portrayed Schwarzenegger as a vibrant and engaging personality with a passion for adventure and fitness, but notes a shift towards self-centeredness and arrogance towards the end of their time together. In her 2006 memoir titled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak, Baker portrays a complex image of Schwarzenegger, including aspects of his infidelity that she discovered post-breakup, reflecting the tumultuous nature of their relationship. Despite some unflattering depictions, Schwarzenegger cooperated with the book by providing a foreword and engaging in a three-hour meeting with Baker.",
        "The environment that surrounds adolescents significantly influences their formation of identity. Although research on adolescents mainly focuses on white, middle-class individuals, studies indicate that a privileged upbringing correlates with a more successful identity development. Adolescence is a critical period for shaping one's identity. Recent demographic trends suggest that the transition to adulthood now spans a longer duration compared to the mid-20th century, highlighting youth as a prominent phase between late adolescence and early adulthood. Consequently, various factors have gained significance during this developmental stage. Numerous elements such as commitment, coping mechanisms, and social media play crucial roles in shaping an adolescent's social identity. These aspects are all impacted by the adolescent's upbringing environment, where individuals from privileged backgrounds often have access to better opportunities and circumstances.",

During adolescence, individuals quickly discern between friends and acquaintances, often forming strong emotional bonds with friends. While this emotional investment is generally beneficial, exposure to negative influences from friends can lead to peer pressure. Adolescence is a crucial phase in social growth as individuals are highly susceptible to the influence of their close relationships. It is a pivotal time when individuals start making independent decisions, rendering it a delicate period.

For instance, Tim Brennan from the Irish-American punk rock group Dropkick Murphys is known for using this instrument alongside electric guitar, bass, drums, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes, all of which contribute to the band's distinctive growling sound. In a similar vein, Peter Buck of R.E.M. introduced memorable mandolin riffs in the band's 1991 hit \"Losing My Religion,\" a style he revisited in numerous other tracks.

Similarly, snakes can be hunted by hawks. Predators can be categorized by their trophic level, with herbivores and primary consumers feeding on autotrophs, and secondary consumers preying on heterotrophs like animals. Secondary consumers are typically carnivores, but there are also tertiary consumers that feed on them, followed by quartary consumers, and so on. As energy diminishes as it moves up the food chain, the chain usually consists of five or six levels, sometimes reaching only three trophic levels, such as a lion preying on large herbivores like wildebeest.",

Upon learning of Husayn's resistance against Yazid I, the residents of Kufa urged Husayn to lead them, prompting him to dispatch his relative Muslim bin Agail to assess their allegiance. Upon hearing of this, Yazid I dispatched Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad from Basrah to Kufa, instructing him to deter the people from supporting Husayn. Ubayd-Allah bin Ziyad successfully dispersed the supporters and arrested Muslim bin Agail.

The Prussian forces, comprising 222 infantry battalions, 186 cavalry squadrons, and 774 guns, were under attack. General De Wimpffen, leader of the French V Corps in reserve, aimed to coordinate an attack involving both infantry and cavalry against the Prussian XI Corps. However, by 11:00, the French suffered significant losses from Prussian artillery fire, compounded by the arrival of more Prussian reinforcements. Despite three bold cavalry charges on the village of Floing, led by General Marguerite, who perished during the initial charge, the French incurred substantial casualties without achieving any significant breakthroughs. As the day drew to a close, any hopes of a decisive victory seemed futile."
