        "Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Unrecorded Chronicles ( Japanese : 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 ) , commonly referred to as Valkyria Chronicles III outside Japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by Sega and Media.Vision for the PlayStation Portable . Released in January 2011 in Japan , it is the third game in the Valkyria series . Employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the \" Nameless \" , a penal military unit serving the nation of Gallia during the Second Europan War who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the Imperial unit \" Calamaty Raven \" .",
        "The game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on Valkyria Chronicles II . While it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers . Character designer Raita Honjou and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa . A large team of writers handled the script . The game 's opening theme was sung by May 'n .",
        "It met with positive sales in Japan , and was praised by both Japanese and western critics . After release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in November of that year . It was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . Due to low sales of Valkyria Chronicles II , Valkyria Chronicles III was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game 's expanded edition was released in 2014 . Media.Vision would return to the franchise with the development of Valkyria : Azure Revolution for the PlayStation 4 .",
        "As with previous Valkyira Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role .",
        "The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon .",
        "Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , Shocktroopers , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier . Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types .",
        "The game takes place during the Second Europan War . Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as \" The Nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , Altaha Abilia , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela Marcellis , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria . Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers .",
        "As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war . While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , Gusurg , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort . This continues until the Nameless 's commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason .",
        "Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . This is short @-@ lived , however , as following Maximilian 's defeat , Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire , kept secret by their benefactor . Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia , it is Dahau 's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation . As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations ' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless , asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon . Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew .",
        "Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , Kishiko Miyagi , Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor .",
        "The majority of material created for previous games , such as the BLiTZ system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by Raita Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world . The main color of the Nameless was black . As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine . The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.",
        "The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game 's opening theme song , \" If You Wish for ... \" ( もしも君が願うのなら , Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May 'n . Its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi , who had worked on May 'n on previous singles .",
        "In September 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by Sega , hinting at a new Valkyria Chronicles game . In its September issue , Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable . Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show ( TGS ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . During the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events , an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011 . The game was released January 27 , 2011 . During an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( DLC ) , but that no plans were finalized . Multiple DLC maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between February and April 2011 . An expanded edition of the game , Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition , released on November 23 , 2011 . Packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , Extra Edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game 's DLC , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions .",
        "Unlike its two predecessors , Valkyria Chronicles III was not released in the west . According to Sega , this was due to poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west . An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012 : players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch , which translated the game 's text into English . Compatible with the Extra Edition , the patch was released in January 2014 .",
        "On its day of release in Japan , Valkyria Chronicles III topped both platform @-@ exclusive and multi @-@ platform sales charts . By early February , the game sold 102 @,@ 779 units , coming in second overall to The Last Story for the Wii . By the end of the year , the game had sold just over 152 @,@ 500 units .",
        "Famitsu enjoyed the story , and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay . Japanese gaming site Game Watch Impress , despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games , was generally positive about its story and characters , and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes . 4Gamer.net writer Naohiko Misuosame , in a \" Play Test \" article based on the game 's PSN demo , felt that Valkyria Chronicles III provided a \" profound feeling of closure \" for the Valkyria Chronicles series . He praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game .",
        "PlayStation Official Magazine - UK praised the story 's blurring of Gallia 's moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . He also positively noted the story 's serious tone . Points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game 's AI .",
        "In a preview of the TGS demo , Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo , along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II . Kotaku 's Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game , citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series . His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition , along with expressing regret that it would not be localized .",
        "Kurt and Riela were featured in the Nintendo 3DS crossover Project X Zone , representing the Valkyria series . Media.Vision would return to the series to develop Valkyria : Azure Revolution , with Ozawa returning as director . Azure Revolution is a role @-@ playing video game for the PlayStation 4 that forms the beginning of a new series within the Valkyria franchise .",
        "Valkyria Chronicles 3 was adapted into a two @-@ episode original video animation series in the same year of its release . Titled Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Taga Tame no Jūsō ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア３ 誰がための銃瘡 , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Wound Taken for Someone 's Sake ) , it was originally released through PlayStation Network and Qriocity between April and May 2011 . The initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to PSN during the early summer of that year . It later released for DVD on June 29 and August 31 , 2011 , with separate \" Black \" and \" Blue \" editions being available for purchase . The anime is set during the latter half of Valkyria Chronicles III , detailing a mission by the Nameless against their Imperial rivals Calamity Raven . The anime was first announced in November 2010 . It was developed by A @-@ 1 Pictures , produced by Shinji Motoyama , directed by Nobuhiro Kondō , and written by Hiroshi Ōnogi . Sakimoto 's music for the game was used in the anime .",
        "The anime 's title was inspired by the principle purpose of the Nameless : to suffer in battle for the goals of others . A subtitle attached to the project during development was \" The Road to Kubinka \" , which referenced the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow . The game 's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . While making the anime , the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . The opening theme , \" Akari ( Light ) -Tomoshibi- \" ( 灯 @-@ TOMOSHIBI- ) , was sung by Japanese singer Faylan . The ending theme , \" Someday the Flowers of Light Will Bloom \" ( いつか咲く光の花 , Itsuka Saku Hikari no Hana ) , was sung by Minami Kuribayashi . Both songs ' lyrics were written by their respective artists .",
        "Two manga adaptations were produced , following each of the game 's main female protagonists Imca and Riela . They were Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Namo naki Chikai no Hana ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 名もなき誓いの花 , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Flower of the Nameless Oath ) , illustrated by Naoyuki Fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in Dengeki Maoh between 2011 and 2012 ; and Senjō no Valkyria 3 : -Akaki Unmei no Ikusa Otome- ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 -赤き運命の戦乙女- , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 -The Valkyrie of the Crimson Fate ) , illustrated by Mizuki Tsuge and eventually released in a single volume by Kadokawa Shoten in 2012 .",
        "The Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal , also known as U.S. Arsenal Building , is a building located in MacArthur Park in downtown Little Rock , Arkansas . Built in 1840 , it was part of Little Rock 's first military installation . Since its decommissioning , The Tower Building has housed two museums . It was home to the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since 2001 . It has also been the headquarters of the Little Rock Æsthetic Club since 1894 .",
        "The building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower . Besides being the last remaining structure of the original Little Rock Arsenal and one of the oldest buildings in central Arkansas , it was also the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur , who became the supreme commander of US forces in the South Pacific during World War II . It was also the starting place of the Camden Expedition . In 2011 it was named as one of the top 10 attractions in the state of Arkansas by Arkansas.com.",
        "The arsenal was constructed at the request of Governor James Sevier Conway in response to the perceived dangers of frontier life and fears of the many Native Americans who were passing through the state on their way to the newly established Oklahoma Territory . Thirty @-@ six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of Little Rock by Major Robert B. Lee of the U.S. Army . The land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club . John Wormley Walker , a builder for the Federal Government , supervised the construction . Originally $ 14 @,@ 000 was allocated for the construction of the arsenal , but proved inadequate . The budget was later increased to $ 30 @,@ 000 . Work began on the Tower Building in 1840 , and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built . Being originally constructed to store ammunition , the building was designed with 3 @-@ foot @-@ thick ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) exterior walls . The original plans called for it to be built of stone , however , masonry was used instead . The Arkansas Gazette referred to the structure as \" A splendid specimen of masonry \" .",
        "For several years the arsenal , which was owned by the federal government , served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers . But in November 1860 , with the American Civil War on the horizon , a company of the Second United States Artillery , consisting of sixty @-@ five men , was transferred to Little Rock under the command of Captain James Totten . On January 15 , 1861 , the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention . It was planned for February 18 ; however , events at the arsenal , would not wait . On January 28 , then Governor Henry Massey Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be \" permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State , by authority of the people , shall have determined to sever their connection with the General Government , \" Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements , although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming . The first telegraph wire to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed . Local attorney John M Harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas 's capital . In his message , Harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal .",
        "The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith . The garrison at Fort Smith had been previously transferred to the United States Arsenal in this city ( Little Rock ) . The arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in the United States and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the tropps [ sic ] ordered from the frontier .",
        "-John M Harrel Telegram , January 31 , 1861",
        "The item was intended simply as a piece of news , but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state , fueling procession sentiment . The rumor was interpreted by some Arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal . By February 5 , six militia units , consisting of 1 @,@ 000 men , with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5 @,@ 000 if the situations deemed it necessary , had assembled in Little Rock . Governor Rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops . Faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of Little Rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops , Governor Rector was forced to take control of the situation . On February 6 , he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to Captain Totten ,",
        "This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities , in order to their security . This movement , although not authorized by me , has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty , as the executive of this Sate , to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command . I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities , to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next .",
        "Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President , Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops . He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions :",
        "The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States .",
        "The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war .",
        "The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders , not as conquered and surrendering soldiers .",
        "On the morning of February 8 , 1861 , Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials . That afternoon , the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head . All of the federal troops had left at this point , except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor 's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person .",
        "The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an \" arsenal of deposit , \" meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis . Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs , nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands . Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board .",
        "Inside the Little Rock Arsenal after its seizure in February , 1861 , the Confederates inventoried some 10 @,@ 247 weapons , 250 @,@ 000 musket cartridges , and 520 @,@ 000 percussion caps , as well as the four bronze cannon of Totten 's battery . Long arms in the Arsenal 's inventory consisted of :",
        "M1822 .69 cal ( flintlock ) 5 @,@ 625",
        "M1822 .69 cal ( percussion @-@ converted ) 53",
        "M1842 .69 cal smoothbore ( percussion ) 357",
        "M1855 .58 cal rifle @-@ muskets 900",
        "M1817 common rifles 125",
        "M1841 rifle ( \" Mississippi Rifle \" ) 54",
        "M1847 musketoon 2",
        "Hall 's carbines 267",
        "Hall 's rifles ( flintlock ) 2 @,@ 864",
        "Total 10 @,@ 247",
        "Of this number , approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable , or ready @-@ for @-@ issue . Note there were only 1 @,@ 364 percussion weapons available . Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy , but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments , mustered in June , 1861 , were issued M1816 / M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks . The 9th and 10th Arkansas , four companies of Kelly 's 9th Arkansas Battalion , and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment were issued flintlock Hall 's Rifles . The units comprising the infantry force of Van Dorn 's Army of the West were the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles were also armed with M1822 flintlocks from the Little Rock Arsenal . By the time the 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments mustered in at Little Rock , the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted , and only old \" junker \" weapons were left .",
        "Most of the equipment , arms , and machinery at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to east of the Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862 , and accountability for it is lost at that point . By all appearances , the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon , Arkansas , and from there to Jackson Mississippi , where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863 .",
        "Major General Thomas C. Hindman , sent to command the district of Arkansas in May , 1862 , found the state nearly destitute of military material . Hindman established another armory at Arkadelphia , and revived the Little Rock Arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms . Hindman recorded :",
        "\" Machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms , and both were turned out in small quantity , but of excellent quality . Lead mines were opened and worked , and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the Ordnance Department and in the manufacture of calomel , castor oil , spirits of nitre , the various tinctures of iron , and other valuable medicines . Most of these works were located at or near Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River , 75 miles south from Little Rock . The tools , machinery , and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor . Nothing of this sort had been before attempted on Government account in Arkansas to my knowledge , except for the manufacture of small arms , the machinery for which was taken away by General Van Dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings � A further supply , along with lead and caps , was procured from the citizens of Little Rock and vicinity by donation , purchases , and impressments .",
        "This ammunition , and that which I brought with me , was rapidly prepared for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose . As illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country , the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the State Library for cartridge paper . Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted , tools purchased or impressed , and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once . But , after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch and that I would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen 'l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances , with which most of them were armed . Two days elapsed before the change could be effected . \"",
        "The Confederate ordnance establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August , 1862 . Looking around for a suitable person to head this activity , General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington . Lt. Dunnington was the commander of the gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain , which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad . Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock , and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department , he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities ( which included artillery functions ) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel .",
        "Lt. Col. Dunnington 's \" Returns for the month of August , 1862 , at Little Rock Arsenal , C.S.A. , \" are found in Vol . 149 , Chapter IV of the \" Captured Rebel Ordnance Records , \" and are most enlightening as to the scope of Confederate ordnance activities at Little Rock during this crucial time . According to Dunnington , \" When I assumed command at this Post , all material had been removed to Arkadelphia . There were no persons employed . No shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition . Material , tools , etc . , had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers . Work commenced the last part of the month . \"",
        "The military force at Little Rock under Dunnington 's command consisted of four officers : himself , Major John B. Lockman , Captain C.C. Green , and 2nd Lt. W.W. Murphy . In addition to these , he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman , 2 clerks , 3 gunsmiths for repairing small arms , a laboratorian , 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory , and a carpenter for making packing boxes .",
        "During the month of August , 1862 , the following work was performed : \" Fabricated : one pair of musket bullet moulds ; 10 @,@ 000 buck & ball shot cartridges ; repaired : 750 muskets , shotguns , and rifles ; received and repaired : ordnance stores and ordnances ; performed : guard , office , and police duties ; inspected : Posts at Camden and Arkadelphia . \"",
        "Lt. Col. Dunnington continued to build up his works at Little Rock until November 1862 , when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner ( composer of The Arkansas Traveler ) was placed in charge of the Arsenal . Dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the Ponchartrain .",
        "A \" Summary of the Work Done for November , 1862 , Little Rock Arsenal \" shows : Fabrication :",
        "75 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - percussion",
        "14 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - flint",

        "Perhaps the most illuminating points of the above \" Summary of Work \" and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was . \" buck & ball \" , indicating that the .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use , and of this , nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons , indicating that no less than a sixth of the Confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons .",
        "The \" Summaries of Work done at Little Rock Arsenal , C.S.A. \" continue at about the same pace and scale from August 1862 until August 1863 . Appended to the \" Summary \" for August , 1863 is the ominous notation , \" During the last week in the month , nearly all stores at the Arsenal have been packed and sent to Arkadelphia , in obedience to orders from Chief of Ordnance , District of Arkansas . \" This then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from Little Rock , with the city being surrendered to the advancing Federal troops of Frederick Steele 's Arkansas Expedition on September 11 , 1863 .",
        "In 1864 , after Little Rock fell to the Union Army and the arsenal had been recaptured , General Fredrick Steele marched 8 @,@ 500 troops from the arsenal beginning the Camden Expedition .",
        "The arsenal was briefly seized once more by Joseph Brooks loyalists during the Brooks @-@ Baxter War of 1874 .",
        "In 1873 , the building was renamed Little Rock Barracks and used as a barracks for married officers and their families . The building was drastically altered the inside and outside . Prior to renovation , a rear basement door provided the only entrance to the building , while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors . By 1868 , front and rear porches had been added to the building , as well as interior walls and stairs , some of which remain today , including the central staircase . In 1880 , Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father , Captain Arthur MacArthur , was stationed there .",
        "In the 1880s , the federal government began closing many small arsenals around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment . The arsenal commander received word from Washington that the Little Rock site must be abandoned \" not later than October 1 , 1890 . \" On April 12 , 1893 the tower building and the surrounding buildings were traded to the city of Little Rock for 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 km ² ) in North Little Rock under the condition that the building and land be \" forever exclusively devoted to the uses and purposes of a public park \" for 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 km ² ) in Big Rock Mountain on the north side of the Arkansas River , present day North Little Rock . That site later became Fort Logan H. Roots . All of the original buildings surrounding the Tower Building were demolished .",
        "In 1894 the Little Rock Æsthetic Club , one of the oldest women 's societies west of the Mississippi River , moved into the Tower Building . This was prompted due to increased membership and a need for larger , more permanent quarters . The previous year , club members working with women 's organizations throughout the state , raised money to furnish the Arkansas Building of the Columbian Exposition at The Chicago World 's Fair . At the fair 's conclusion , artifacts from the exhibit were displayed in the Tower Building , with the Æsthetic Club invited to meet in the \" Columbian Room . \"",
        "Except for Æsthetic Club meetings , the Tower Building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration . The Æsthetic Club provided much @-@ needed financial support during the period and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression . The Æsthetic Club is still headquartered in the Tower Building .",
        "The building and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century . The Tower Building served as headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion , May 15 – 18 , 1911 . Over 106 @,@ 000 Civil War veterans , the largest popular gathering in the history of the city up to that time , attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park , which had also become a popular camping area . Later the building served as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard . In 1912 , the second floor of the Tower Building became Little Rock 's first public library . In 1917 , Little Rock built a fire station in the park , that building is now gone . A band shell named for H. H. Foster also was built in the park during this time , but also no longer exists . In 1936 , Works Progress Administration built the Museum of Fine Arts , now called the Arkansas Arts Center , just south of the Tower Building .",
        "The arsenal was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 . Due to its association with the Camden Expedition of 1864 , the arsenal may be included in the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark designated in 1994 .",
        "In 1942 , the Tower Building was renovated due to the efforts of the Æsthetic Club , Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop , and the Works Progress Administration . It became the new home of The Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities , which had been located in Little Rock City Hall . The museum remained in the tower building for approximately fifty @-@ five years . The area surrounding the Tower Building had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park . Due to the efforts of Bernie Babcock , however , the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur .",
        "In 1997 , the Museum of Science and Natural History merged with the Little Rock Children 's Museum , which had been located in Union Station , to form the Arkansas Museum of Discovery . The new museum was relocated to a historic building in the Little Rock River Market District . The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History opened on May 19 , 2001 in the Tower Building . The new museum 's goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of Arkansas , preserve the Tower Building , honor servicemen and servicewomen of the United States and commemorate the birthplace of Douglas MacArthur .",
        "Cicely Mary Barker ( 28 June 1895 – 16 February 1973 ) was an English illustrator best known for a series of fantasy illustrations depicting fairies and flowers . Barker 's art education began in girlhood with correspondence courses and instruction at the Croydon School of Art . Her earliest professional work included greeting cards and juvenile magazine illustrations , and her first book , Flower Fairies of the Spring , was published in 1923 . Similar books were published in the following decades .",
        "Barker was a devout Anglican , and donated her artworks to Christian fundraisers and missionary organizations . She produced a few Christian @-@ themed books such as The Children ’ s Book of Hymns and , in collaboration with her sister Dorothy , He Leadeth Me . She designed a stained glass window for St. Edmund 's Church , Pitlake , and her painting of the Christ Child , The Darling of the World Has Come , was purchased by Queen Mary .",
        "Barker was equally proficient in watercolour , pen and ink , oils , and pastels . Kate Greenaway and the Pre @-@ Raphaelites were the principal influences on her work . She claimed to paint instinctively and rejected artistic theories . Barker died in 1973 . Though she published Flower Fairy books with spring , summer , and autumn themes , it wasn 't until 1985 that a winter collection was assembled from her remaining work and published posthumously .",
        "Barker was born the second daughter and youngest child of Walter Barker , a partner in a seed supply company and an amateur artist , and his wife Mary Eleanor ( Oswald ) Barker on 28 June 1895 at home at 66 Waddon Road in Croydon , Surrey , England . Barker was an epileptic as a child , and cared for at home by her parents . Later , her sister and elder by two years , Dorothy Oswald Barker , continued the care .",
        "The family of four was moderately well off , and belonged to the lower end of the upper middle class . A nanny , a governess , and a cook to prepare special meals for Barker were hired . She spent much time in bed at home amusing herself with painting books and a nursery library that included the works of Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott – two artists who exerted strong influences on her later art .",
        "Barker took correspondence courses in art , probably until about 1919 . In 1908 at 13 years , she entered an evening class at the Croydon School of Art , and attended the school into the 1940s . In time , she received a teaching position .",
        "In 1911 , Raphael Tuck & Sons bought four of Barker 's \" little drawings \" for half a sovereign , and published them as postcards . In October 1911 , she won second prize in the Croydon Art Society 's poster competition , and shortly afterward was elected the youngest member of the Society . The art critic for the Croydon Advertiser remarked , \" Her drawings show a remarkable freedom of spirit . She has distinct promise . \"",
        "Following her father ’ s death in June 1912 , the seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Barker submitted art and poetry to My Magazine , Child ’ s Own , Leading Strings , and Raphael Tuck annuals in an effort to support both her mother and sister . Her sister Dorothy taught kindergarten in two private schools before opening a kindergarten at home . She brought in some money for the family 's support while supervising the household .",
        "Fairies became a popular theme in art and literature in the early 20th century following the releases of The Coming of the Fairies by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie , and the fairy @-@ themed work of Australian Ida Rentoul Outhwaite . Queen Mary made such themes even more popular by sending Outhwaite postcards to friends during the 1920s . In 1918 , Barker produced a postcard series depicting elves and fairies .",
        "In 1923 , Barker sent her flower fairy paintings to various publishers . Blackie paid £ 25 for 24 paintings with accompanying verses , but it wasn 't until publication of Flower Fairies of the Summer in 1925 that Barker received royalties for her work . Mary Violet Clayton Calthrop , wife of author Dion Clayton Calthrop , wrote in April 1925 about Barker and Flower Fairies of the Spring : \" She has such exquisite taste , besides draughtsmanship . \"",
        "In 1924 , the family moved into a four @-@ level , semi @-@ detached Victorian house at 23 The Waldrons . Barker had a studio built in the garden and her sister conducted a kindergarten in a room at the back of the house . The family lived frugally and attended both St. Edmund 's and St. Andrew 's in Croydon – \" low \" churches for the less privileged . Barker sometimes incorporated portraits of her fellow parishioners in her religious works . She was described by Canon Ingram Hill as \" one of the pillars \" of St. Andrew 's .",
        "The children in the kindergarten modelled for the Flower Fairies until the kindergarten closed in 1940 . In an interview in 1958 , Barker said , \" My sister ran a kindergarten and I used to borrow her students for models . For many years I had an atmosphere of children about me – I never forgot it . \" She also painted the children of relatives as well as Gladys Tidy , the Barkers ' young housekeeper , who posed for the Primrose Fairy in 1923 . The plants were painted from life , and if a specimen was not readily at hand , Kew Gardens staff would provide her the specimens needed . Barker designed and built the Flower Fairy costumes , and based each on the flowers and leaves of the particular plant to be illustrated . The costumes were kept in a trunk in her studio along with wings made of twigs and gauze . Each was broken down after an illustration was completed and the parts recycled for other costumes . She often referred to Dion Clayton Calthrop 's English Costume .",
        "In the late 1920s , Barker began to doubt she was doing enough for the church and considered focusing solely on sacred works . Family and friends recommended she continue secular and sacred works , which she did .",
        "Barker continued to attend evening classes at the Croydon Art School between the 1920s and the 1940s , eventually receiving a teaching position . She took sketching trips to Amberley and Storrington in Sussex and to Cornwall and the southern coast with family and friends . She visited and stayed with artist Margaret Tarrant in Gomshall , Surrey and with family in Ugglebarnby , Near Whitby , North Yorkshire .",
        "In 1940 , the Barker 's live @-@ in maid retired , and Dorothy Barker closed her school at the back of the house in The Waldrons . She continued to supervise the household , and to give both her mother and sister the care they needed . Dorothy and her sister collaborated upon only two books : Our Darling 's First Book and the Christian @-@ themed , He Leadeth Me . In 1954 Dorothy Barker died of a heart attack . Barker was unable to pursue her art to any significant extent following her sister 's death , as all the care of her aged mother devolved upon her , but she did manage to begin planning a stained glass window design in her sister 's memory for St. Edmund 's , Pitlake .",
        "Barker 's mother died in 1960 , and , in 1961 , Barker moved from 23 The Waldrons to 6 Duppas Avenue in Croydon . She restored a maisonette in Storrington , Sussex , England , bequeathed by her friend Edith Major , and named it St. Andrew 's . After taking up residence , her health began to deteriorate . She was in and out of nursing and convalescent homes , and tended by relatives and friends .",
        "Barker died at Worthing Hospital on 16 February 1973 , aged 77 years . Two funeral services were held – one in Storrington Church and one in Barker 's maisonette . Her ashes were scattered in Storrington churchyard . In 1989 , Frederick Warne , a division of Penguin Books since 1983 , acquired the Flower Fairies properties .",
        "Barker worked principally in watercolor with pen @-@ and @-@ ink , but she was equally competent in black @-@ and @-@ white , in oils , and in pastels . She carried a sketchbook with her for capturing interesting children . She once indicated , \" I have always tried to paint instinctively in a way that comes naturally to me , without any real thought or attention to artistic theories . \"",
        "Kate Greenaway was a childhood favorite and an influence on her art . Barker 's child subjects wear nostalgic clothing as Greenaway 's children do , though Barker 's children are less melancholy and less flat in appearance , due perhaps to advances in printing technology . Barker studied flowers with an analytical eye and was friend to children 's illustrator , Margaret Tarrant . Along with Greenaway , illustrator Alice B. Woodward also influenced Barker 's work .",
        "The Pre @-@ Raphaelites were a strong , lifelong influence on Barker . She once indicated , \" I am to some extent influenced by them — not in any technical sense , but in the choice of subject matter and the feeling and atmosphere they could achieve . \" She admitted a fondness for the early paintings of John Everett Millais and \" the wonderful things \" of Edward Burne @-@ Jones .",
        "Barker 's sketches , drawings , and paintings of children were given to friends or to the parents of the subjects , donated to charitable institutions and church sponsored events , or exhibited through various art organizations . She illustrated magazine covers , dust jackets , and produced series of postcards for Raphael Tuck and other publishers such as Picturesque Children of the Allies ( 1915 ) , Seaside Holidays ( 1918 ) , and Shakespeare 's Boy and Girl Characters ( 1917 , 1920 ) . Her own Old Rhymes for All Times ( 1928 ) and The Lord of the Rushie River ( 1938 ) , a tale about a girl who lives among swans on a riverbank , were critically well received . Set about 1800 , Groundsel and Necklaces ( 1943 ) tells of a girl named Jenny who rescues her family from poverty through the agency of the fairies . The story features an old Scrooge @-@ like man called Mr. Petercoo and tonally suggests a Dickensian social consciousness . Simon the Swan , intended as a sequel to Rushie River was outlined in 1943 with Groundsel , but only developed in 1953 . It was published posthumously in 1988 and is critically considered less successful than Groundsel .",
        "Barker was a devout Christian , and produced religious @-@ themed works throughout her life . She published eight postcards and five guardian angel birthday cards for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in 1916 and in 1923 respectively . Christmas cards were designed for The Girls ' Friendly Society over a 20 @-@ year period , and the first three designs sold out a combined printing of 46 @,@ 500 in 1923 . An original design for the society called The Darling of the World Has Come was purchased by Queen Mary for ₤ 5 @.@ 5 @.@ 0 in 1926 . The Croydon Art Society hung Barker 's booklet cover design for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in its November 1919 exhibition .",
        "Religious @-@ themed books include The Children 's Book of Hymns ( 1929 ) and He Leadeth Me ( 1933 ) , the latter written in collaboration with her sister . Major religious works include the triptychs in oil , The Feeding of the Five Thousand ( 1929 ) , for the chapel in Llandaff House , a home for destitute women at Penarth , Wales , and The Parable of the Great Supper ( 1934 ) for St. George 's Chapel , Waddon . The Feeding has since disappeared , and only a black @-@ and @-@ white photograph dated 1929 reproduces the work . In 1941 , she completed oil panels on the subject of the seven sacraments for the baptismal font at St. Andrew 's , South Croydon . She designed baptismal rolls for the wall behind the font in 1948 and 1962 . In 1946 , she completed the 4 x 7 ft. oil painting , Out of Great Tribulation , for the Memorial Chapel of Norbury Methodist Church . Following the death of her sister in 1954 , Barker began designs for a stained glass memorial window depicting Christ preparing to wash the feet of his disciples . Her last religious @-@ themed work , it was installed in St. Edmund 's , Pitlake , in 1962 .",

        "Senjō no Valkyria 3: Unrecorded Chronicles, known as Valkyria Chronicles III internationally, is a tactical role-playing video game created by Sega and Media.Vision for the PlayStation Portable. Launched in January 2011 in Japan, it is the third installment in the Valkyria series. The gameplay maintains the blend of tactical and real-time elements found in its predecessors. The narrative unfolds concurrently with the initial game, tracing the exploits of the \"Nameless,\" a penal military group dedicated to Gallia during the Second Europan War. Tasked with clandestine operations, they face off against the Imperial squad \"Calamity Raven.\"",
        "Development of the game started in 2010, building upon much of the progress made during the creation of Valkyria Chronicles II. The game preserved the core elements of the series but also went through various refinements, including efforts to make it more accessible to new players. Notably, character designer Raita Honjou, composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa all reprised their roles. The narrative was crafted by a team of writers, and the opening theme was performed by May'n.",
        "The game was well-received in Japan, garnering positive sales and acclaim from critics in both Japan and the West. Following its release, additional downloadable content was made available, along with an enhanced version in November of the same year. It was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series. Due to the underwhelming sales of Valkyria Chronicles II, Valkyria Chronicles III did not receive an official localization. However, a fan translation compatible with the game's enhanced edition was launched in 2014. Media.Vision later reengaged with the franchise by developing Valkyria: Azure Revolution for the PlayStation 4.",
        "Similar to its predecessors, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical RPG where players lead a military unit in missions against enemy forces. The narrative unfolds through comic book-style panels featuring animated character portraits, with characters dialoguing through a combination of voiced speech bubbles and unvoiced text. Players advance through a series of linear missions, gradually unlocking maps for free exploration and replay. The path to each story location varies based on player decisions, with choices leading to different outcomes. In between missions, player characters rest at a camp for customization and character development. Character-specific sub-missions are available alongside the main story, and upon completion of the game, additional challenging episodes can be accessed. Love simulation elements involving the main heroines are included, albeit playing a minor role in the overall gameplay experience.",
        "The battle system of the game, known as the BliTZ system, is directly inherited from Valkyria Chronicles. In missions, players choose each unit by viewing the battlefield map from a top-down perspective. Once a character is chosen, the player navigates the character in a third-person view on the battlefield. Characters are limited to one action per turn, but they can receive additional turns at the cost of other characters' turns. Movement and actions are constrained by each character's Action Gauge. A maximum of nine characters can be included in a mission. Characters vocalize various situations during gameplay, like low health points (HP) or being attacked by enemies. Each character possesses distinct \"Potentials,\" which are unique skills. These include \"Personal Potentials,\" inherent abilities that can aid or hinder a character, and \"Battle Potentials,\" which improve as the game progresses and always benefit a character. Characters develop Battle Potentials through a personalized \"Masters Table,\" a grid-based skill system for acquiring and connecting different skills. Additionally, characters have Special Abilities that provide temporary advantages in battles, such as Kurt's \"Direct Command\" that allows movement without depleting the Action Point gauge, Reila's transformation into her invincible \"Valkyria Form,\" and Imca's ability to target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.",
        "Soldiers are categorized into five groups: Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, Lancers, and Armored Soldiers. They have the flexibility to transition between classes by simply altering their designated weapon, without experiencing significant changes in their acquired stats from the previous class. Following a successful battle, the squad earns experience points, which are then allocated to enhance five distinct attributes collectively shared by the entire squad. This feature sets it apart from the traditional method observed in earlier games, where experience points were distributed based on different unit types.",
        "The setting of the game is the Second Europan War, where the Gallian Army Squad 422, nicknamed \"The Nameless,\" is introduced. This unit is made up of criminals, foreign deserters, and military offenders whose identities have been wiped from the records and are instead identified by numbers. Despite being assigned the most perilous missions overlooked by the Regular Army and Militia, they live up to their motto, \"Always Ready,\" exemplified by their unwavering determination. The storyline revolves around the primary characters, including No.7 Kurt Irving, an unjustly accused army officer striving for redemption; Ace No.1 Imca, a female Darcsen expert in heavy weaponry seeking vengeance against the Valkyria responsible for her homeland's devastation; and No.13 Riela Marcellis, an apparently unlucky young woman who is revealed to be a descendant of the Valkyria. Alongside their comrades, they are entrusted with combating the enigmatic Imperial faction, Calamity Raven, predominantly comprised of Darcsen soldiers.",
        "The Nameless, though officially unrecognized, are covertly utilized by top Gallian Army officials to undertake missions that could tarnish Gallia's reputation in the ongoing war. The strategy of plausible deniability is employed to distance the army from their actions. While some missions, like a successful incursion into Imperial territory, prove beneficial, others bring great distress to certain members of the 422nd unit. Gusurg, a member of the unit, driven by anger, defects to Calamity Raven, attracted by the promise of Darcsen independence championed by their leader, Dahau. Simultaneously, factions within the Gallian Army Command seek to eliminate the Nameless to safeguard their own interests. Caught between allies and foes, and facing betrayal from within, the 422nd struggles to survive while supporting Gallia's war endeavors. The situation escalates until Ramsey Crowe, the Nameless' leader held under house arrest, is brought to Randgriz, the capital, to reveal evidence clearing the soldiers' names and exposing the true traitor - the Gallian General who falsely accused Kurt of treason.",
        "Due to a combination of factors, including significant manpower losses suffered by Gallia towards the end of the war with the Empire, the Nameless are formally integrated into the Gallian Army instead of operating covertly. This arrangement is short-lived, however, as following Maximilian's defeat, Dahau and Calamity Raven seek to activate a long-hidden Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire. With their ties to Maximilian severed and their chance to prove themselves in the Gallian conflict gone, Dahau sees this weapon as a final gambit to establish a new Darcsen nation. Recognizing that an armed Gallian incursion into the Empire right after the cease-fire would jeopardize the fragile peace, Kurt decides to revert his squad back to the Nameless, instructing Crowe to report all members as deceased. Free from external allegiances, the 422nd unit faces Dahau and successfully dismantles the Valkyrian weapon. Subsequently, each member embarks on a new path, parting ways to start afresh.",
        "Planning for Valkyria Chronicles III commenced after the completion of Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010, followed by the onset of full-fledged development. Takeshi Ozawa, the director of Valkyria Chronicles II, resumed his role for the third installment. The development phase spanned around a year. Following the launch of Valkyria Chronicles II, the team analyzed the game's reception and contemplated the future direction of the series. Similar to its forerunner, Valkyria Chronicles III was tailored for the PlayStation Portable to enhance the gameplay mechanics originated in Valkyria Chronicles II, as no groundbreaking concept for a PlayStation 3 iteration had surfaced. In an interview, the development team regarded Valkyria Chronicles III as the series' inaugural genuine sequel, highlighting the opportunity to refine the positive aspects of Valkyria Chronicles II on the same platform. Alongside Sega's existing team, Media.Vision also contributed to the development. The storyline, penned by Kazuki Yamanobe, bore a darker and more melancholic tone compared to its precursor. The script was crafted by Hiroyuki Fujii, Koichi Majima, Kishiko Miyagi, Seiki Nagakawa, and Takayuki Shouji.",
        "The majority of content from previous games, like the BLiTZ system and map design, was retained for the latest installment. However, enhancements were introduced to the game's visuals, and certain aspects were expanded, such as map structures, mission formats, and the quantity of playable units per mission. Part of the upgrade process included developing distinct polygon models for each character's physique. To accommodate these improvements, collaborative features from the second game were eliminated due to their significant memory consumption. Difficulty levels and user-friendliness were also adjusted to attract new players while preserving the series' core gameplay elements. The new systems were established early in the development phase. Character designs were crafted by Raita Honjou, known for his work on previous Valkyria Chronicles titles. When designing the Nameless Squad, Honjou faced a challenge similar to that of the first game: military uniforms hindered individuality, despite the necessity for distinct characters that players could easily recognize within the Valkyria Chronicles universe. The primary color scheme for the Nameless Squad was black. Like its predecessors, Valkyria Chronicles III utilized the CANVAS graphics engine, with the anime opening created by Production I.G.",
        "The music for the game was created by Hitoshi Sakimoto, known for his work on previous Valkyria Chronicles installments. Initially, Sakimoto anticipated a lighter tone similar to the previous games but was surprised by the darker themes in this project. He had to redo the main theme multiple times during production to align it with the game's revised direction. At first, the main theme was composed using an orchestra, but Sakimoto later removed elements like the guitar and bass, opting for a synthesizer to refine the theme. The rejected main theme was repurposed as a hopeful tune for the game's ending. The battle themes were crafted to depict a contemporary conflict using modern musical instruments and atonality. Despite being accustomed to synthesized music, Sakimoto decided to include live instruments like the orchestra and guitar. Mitsuhiro Ohta played the guitar and arranged several tracks. The opening theme, \"If You Wish for...\" was performed by Japanese singer May'n and emphasized the soldiers' motivation to protect what they cherished rather than a sense of duty. The lyrics were penned by Seiko Fujibayashi, who had collaborated with May'n on previous songs.",
        "Sega unveiled a teaser website in September 2010, hinting at a new installment in the Valkyria Chronicles series. Famitsu's September issue confirmed the upcoming release of Senjō no Valkyria 3 on the PlayStation Portable. The game made its debut at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show (TGS) with a playable demo for journalists and attendees. To avoid revealing too much of the story to potential players, details were kept minimal during the initial promotional phase, as certain aspects of the game were still being finalized. A serialized Flash visual novel penned by Fujii was released starting in January 2011 to introduce the narrative leading up to the game's events. The official release date for the game was January 27, 2011. While the development team mentioned the possibility of downloadable content (DLC) during an interview, no concrete plans had been made. Subsequently, various DLC maps containing extra missions and recruitable characters were rolled out from February to April 2011. A reissued version titled Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition hit the shelves on November 23, 2011, offering seven additional episodes at a reduced price compared to the original game. This edition included three new episodes, three selected from the game's DLC, and one exclusive as a pre-order incentive. Players who owned the original game had the option to transfer their saved data between the different versions.",
        "Valkyria Chronicles III did not see a release in Western markets unlike the first two installments. Sega attributed this decision to the underwhelming sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the lack of popularity of the PSP in the West. To address this, an unofficial fan translation project was initiated in February 2012. Players who owned a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could access and install the patch, which effectively translated the game's text into English. The patch, which was also compatible with the Extra Edition, was eventually made available in January 2014.",
        "Upon its debut in Japan, Valkyria Chronicles III achieved the highest sales across both exclusive and multi-platform charts. As of early February, the game had sold 102,779 units, securing the second position overall, following The Last Story for the Wii. By the conclusion of the year, total sales for the game had surpassed 152,500 units.",
        "Famitsu praised the narrative and was especially satisfied with the enhancements made to the gameplay. Game Watch Impress, a Japanese gaming website, while acknowledging issues with pacing and recycled elements from previous installments, expressed overall positivity towards the story and characters. They also found the gameplay engaging, despite occasional challenging difficulty spikes. Naohiko Misuosame, a writer for 4Gamer.net, shared his opinions in a \"Play Test\" article based on the game's PSN demo. He felt that Valkyria Chronicles III brought a sense of conclusion to the series, commending its gameplay while also pointing out frustrating constraints on features like special abilities. Additionally, he appreciated the shift in the story's tone back to that of the original game.",
        "The PlayStation Official Magazine - UK commended the narrative's depiction of Gallia's moral ambiguity, its art style, and various aspects of its gameplay, particularly praising the improvements in balance and content. However, it pointed out a significant flaw in the form of multiple difficulty spikes, a recurring issue from previous installments. Heath Hindman from PlayStation Lifestyle lauded the introduction of non-linear elements and the refinements made to mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II, while also appreciating the familiar gameplay style. He highlighted the story's serious undertones. Criticisms raised in the evaluation included the reuse of certain elements, awkward cutscenes featuring all characters unnecessarily, pacing problems, and occasional AI issues.",
        "During a TGS demo preview, Ryan Geddes from IGN expressed excitement about the game's future trajectory post-demo, highlighting enhanced visuals compared to Valkyria Chronicles II. Similarly, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the game, considering its story a resurgence from Valkyria Chronicles II and hailing its gameplay as the pinnacle of the series. However, Eisenbeis critiqued the game for its brevity, repetitive gameplay, and lamented the lack of localization.",
        "Kurt and Riela made an appearance in Project X Zone on Nintendo 3DS, representing the Valkyria series. Media.Vision came back to helm Valkyria: Azure Revolution, with Ozawa back as the director. This game, designed for the PlayStation 4, marks the start of a fresh chapter in the Valkyria franchise, serving as a role-playing video game.",
        "In the year of its release, Valkyria Chronicles 3 was transformed into a two-episode original video animation series. The series, titled Senjō no Valkyria 3: Taga Tame no Jūsō (Valkyria of the Battlefield 3: The Wound Taken for Someone's Sake), was initially available on PlayStation Network and Qriocity between April and May 2011. However, due to a PSN interruption during that summer, the release and availability period had to be extended. Subsequently, the episodes were released on DVD on June 29 and August 31, 2011, with options to purchase separate \"Black\" and \"Blue\" editions. The storyline of the anime occurs during the latter part of Valkyria Chronicles III, focusing on a mission undertaken by the Nameless group against their Imperial adversaries, Calamity Raven. The anime project was first unveiled in November 2010 and was brought to life by A-1 Pictures, produced by Shinji Motoyama, directed by Nobuhiro Kondō, and scripted by Hiroshi Ōnogi. The musical score composed by Sakimoto for the game was also featured in the anime adaptation.",
        "The anime's title was derived from the primary purpose of the Nameless soldiers: to endure battles for the objectives of others. During the project's development, it was temporarily labeled as \"The Road to Kubinka,\" a nod to the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow. The central theme of the game revolved around the characters rediscovering their identities when stripped of their names, exploring broader themes of war and its aftermath. Sega instructed the production team to strive for realism in the anime, leading to thorough research into details like the impact of vehicle damage. The opportunity for the cast of Valkyria Chronicles to make appearances in the anime, set in a parallel timeline to the original game, was well-received by the team. The opening theme, \"Akari (Light) -Tomoshibi-\" was performed by Japanese artist Faylan, while the ending theme, \"Someday the Flowers of Light Will Bloom,\" was sung by Minami Kuribayashi, with lyrics composed by the respective singers.",
        "Two manga adaptations were created based on the main female protagonists Imca and Riela from the game. The first one, Senjō no Valkyria 3: Namo naki Chikai no Hana (Valkyria of the Battlefield 3: The Flower of the Nameless Oath), illustrated by Naoyuki Fujisawa, was serialized in Dengeki Maoh between 2011 and 2012 before being released in two volumes. The second adaptation, Senjō no Valkyria 3: -Akaki Unmei no Ikusa Otome- (Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 -The Valkyrie of the Crimson Fate), illustrated by Mizuki Tsuge, was published in a single volume by Kadokawa Shoten in 2012.",
        "Situated in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas, the Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal, also recognized as the U.S. Arsenal Building, was constructed in 1840 as an integral component of the city's initial military compound. Following its closure, the Tower Building became the site for two museums. Initially accommodating the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from 1942 until 1997, it has served as the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since 2001. Furthermore, it has been the operational base for the Little Rock Æsthetic Club since 1894.",
        "Named after its unique octagonal tower, the building is known for being the sole surviving edifice of the original Little Rock Arsenal and one of the oldest in central Arkansas. Notably, it holds historical significance as the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, the revered supreme commander of US forces in the South Pacific during World War II. Additionally, it marks the beginning of the Camden Expedition. Its historical importance was recognized in 2011 when it was ranked among the top 10 attractions in Arkansas by Arkansas.com.",
        "The arsenal was built in response to Governor James Sevier Conway's concerns about the dangers of frontier life and the presence of Native Americans traveling through the state to the Oklahoma Territory. Major Robert B. Lee of the U.S. Army secured thirty-six acres on the outskirts of Little Rock for its construction, a site previously used as a racetrack. Supervised by John Wormley Walker, a Federal Government builder, the project was originally budgeted at $14,000 but required an increase to $30,000. Construction, starting in 1840, began with the Tower Building, the first permanent structure of the arsenal, featuring 3-foot-thick exterior walls, although initially planned in stone, masonry was used instead, earning praise from the Arkansas Gazette as \"A splendid specimen of masonry.\"",
        "For years, the federal government owned the arsenal, using it as a basic arms storage facility with minimal military personnel. However, as the American Civil War loomed in November 1860, a unit of sixty-five soldiers from the Second United States Artillery, led by Captain James Totten, was stationed at Little Rock. The state legislature decided on January 15, 1861, to hold a referendum to determine the potential secession issue, scheduled for February 18. Governor Henry Massey Rector informed Captain Totten on January 28 that the federal troops could remain at the arsenal until the state decided on its position. Despite rumors of reinforcements, Totten, acting on orders from the US Government, sought additional support via letters and telegrams, utilizing the newly completed telegraph line between Little Rock and Memphis. Attorney John M Harrel drafted Arkansas's first telegraph message, reporting unverified claims of more federal troops heading to the Little Rock Arsenal.",
        "All American soldiers stationed at the outposts on the western frontier and in the Indian nation have been summoned from their winter encampments to bolster the troops at Fort Smith. The garrison at Fort Smith was earlier relocated to the United States Arsenal in Little Rock. This arsenal, considered one of the most well-stocked military storage facilities in the country, is believed to be the final stop for the troops being moved from the frontier.",
        "John M. Harrel Telegram, January 31, 1861.",
        "Originally intended as a mere news item, the information quickly spread across the state via telegraph lines, igniting a sense of urgency among the populace. Some residents of Arkansas misinterpreted the news as a directive from the governor to gather and assist in removing the federal troops from the arsenal. By February 5, six militia units, totaling 1,000 men, had mobilized in Little Rock, with the potential to increase to 5,000 if needed. Governor Rector vehemently refuted giving any such orders to assemble troops. Faced with the unexpected gathering and public opinion against conflict, Governor Rector took charge of the situation. On February 6, he formally requested the surrender of the arsenal from Captain Totten.",
        "The citizens of this State are driven by an urgent sense that, in the current crisis, the State authorities should have control over the arms and war supplies in the Arsenal for their safety. Although not sanctioned by me, this initiative has gained significant momentum, necessitating my intervention as the State's executive to prevent potential conflict between the State residents and the Federal troops under your command. Hence, I officially request, in the State's name, the transfer of the Arsenal and war materials under your supervision to the State authorities, to be maintained pending the decisions of the upcoming convention on March 4th.",
        "Due to the fact that Abraham Lincoln had not been sworn in as President, Captain Totten did not receive any directives from his higher-ups, compelling him to retreat with his soldiers. He consented to hand over the arsenal on the condition that the governor assented to three specific terms:",
        "The governor will seize the arsenal on behalf of the United States.",
        "Soldiers are permitted to move in any direction with their personal and public belongings, excluding weapons, without any hindrance.",
        "The soldiers would have the permission to depart marching as individuals following commands, rather than as a defeated and submitting military force.",
        "On February 8, 1861, Rector and Totten reached a mutual agreement to transfer the arsenal to state authorities. Later that day, accompanied by Governor Rector, the civilian militia proceeded to the arsenal. By then, all federal troops had departed, leaving only Totten, who remained to hear the Governor's address and officially transfer control of the arsenal in person.",
        "In 1860, the Little Rock Arsenal was designated as an \"arsenal of deposit,\" serving as a storage facility for weapons reserved for the state militia during emergencies. When the Arsenal came under State control, there were limited activities related to producing or repairing weapons, or making cartridges. The Arkansas Military Board had to initiate these operations from the ground up.",
        "Following the capture of the Little Rock Arsenal in February 1861, Confederate forces conducted an inventory that revealed around 10,247 weapons, 250,000 musket cartridges, and 520,000 percussion caps. Additionally, they found the four bronze cannon belonging to Totten's battery. The inventory included various long arms.",
        "M1822 .69 caliber flintlock musket with a weight of 5.625 pounds.",
        "M1822 .69 caliber musket converted to percussion, 53 inches in length.",
        "M1842 smoothbore musket, caliber .69, with percussion firing mechanism, 357.",
        "900 .58 caliber rifle-muskets manufactured in 1855.",
        "One hundred twenty-five M1817 rifles were commonly used.",
        "The M1841 rifle, also known as the \"Mississippi Rifle,\" was a .54 caliber weapon.",
        "M1847 musketoon 2",
        "Hall has 267 carbines.",
        "Hall's flintlock rifles, two in total, are priced at 864.",
        "A sum total of ten thousand two hundred forty-seven.",
        "Approximately 9600 weapons were found to be in working condition and ready for use. Out of these, only 1364 were percussion weapons. The distribution of these weapons from the Arsenal is not entirely clear, but it is believed that the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, which were enlisted in June 1861, were equipped with M1816/M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks. Other units such as the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry, four companies of Kelly's 9th Arkansas Battalion, and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment were issued flintlock Hall's Rifles. Additionally, the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles of Van Dorn's Army of the West were also armed with M1822 flintlocks from the Little Rock Arsenal. When the 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments were mustered in at Little Rock, the supply of arms had significantly dwindled, leaving only outdated weapons available.",
        "In April and May 1862, the majority of the equipment, arms, and machinery from the Little Rock Arsenal were relocated east of the Mississippi River under the directive of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn. The whereabouts of these items became unknown at that juncture. It seems that the equipment was transported along the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, and subsequently to Jackson, Mississippi. It is likely that the equipment met its demise during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.",
        "In May 1862, Major General Thomas C. Hindman was appointed to lead the Arkansas district, where he discovered a severe lack of military resources. To address this issue, Hindman set up a new armory in Arkadelphia and reinvigorated the Little Rock Arsenal to serve as a hub for gathering and producing small arms, as well as storing ammunition. Hindman documented his efforts by stating:",
        "Machinery was constructed to produce percussion caps and firearms, with a focus on maintaining a high standard despite the limited quantity manufactured. Additionally, efforts were made to operate lead mines, establish a chemical laboratory, and produce various medicinal products to support the Ordnance Department. These activities were primarily centered around Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River, approximately 75 miles south of Little Rock. The tools, machinery, and materials were either collected gradually or crafted through manual labor. Prior to this initiative, Arkansas had not undertaken such projects for the Government, apart from small arms manufacturing. General Van Dorn had previously removed the machinery for this purpose. Due to the lack of capital and citizen involvement, extra resources, including lead, caps, and supplies, were acquired through donations, purchases, and impressments from the residents of Little Rock and its surroundings.",
        "The ammunition, along with what I had brought, was quickly readied for use at the Laboratory set up at the Little Rock Arsenal for this purpose. To highlight the dire shortage of materials in the area, it should be noted that public documents from the State Library had to be utilized for cartridge paper. Gunsmiths were enlisted or drafted, tools were bought or confiscated, and the process of repairing the damaged firearms I had brought and a similar number found at Little Rock began immediately. However, upon assessing the progress and witnessing the determination of the men, I concluded that a force of 500 could withstand Fitch, and I resolved to lead the remaining roughly 1500 to General Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles from Little Rock could replace the majority's current arms of pikes and lances. It took two days before this transition could be completed.",
        "In August 1862, the Confederate ordnance establishment in Little Rock was reactivated. General Hindman, seeking a suitable leader, enlisted Lieutenant John W. Dunnington from the Confederate Navy. Lt. Dunnington, previously in charge of the gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, brought to Little Rock for conversion to an ironclad, was chosen to oversee the ordnance works. Despite receiving pay from the Confederate Navy Department, Lt. Dunnington assumed control of all Confederate ordnance operations, including artillery duties, in Little Rock with the title of lieutenant colonel.",
        "The \"Returns for the month of August, 1862, at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A.,\" as documented by Lt. Col. Dunnington in Vol. 149, Chapter IV of the \"Captured Rebel Ordnance Records,\" provide valuable insights into the extent of Confederate ordnance operations at Little Rock during this significant period. Lt. Col. Dunnington noted that upon assuming command at the Post, all resources had been relocated to Arkadelphia, and there was a lack of personnel, operational shops for weapon repairs, or ammunition production. The procurement of materials, tools, and the hiring of workers were necessary tasks that initiated towards the end of the month.",
        "Dunnington led a military contingent in Little Rock comprising of four officers: Major John B. Lockman, Captain C.C. Green, and 2nd Lt. W.W. Murphy. Alongside them were 20 enlisted men and a civilian team including a foreman, 2 clerks, 3 gunsmiths specializing in small arms repair, a laboratorian, 26 laborers working in the ammunition laboratory, and a carpenter tasked with constructing packing boxes.",
        "In August 1862, the following tasks were completed: manufacturing a pair of musket bullet molds, producing 10,000 buck and ball shot cartridges, fixing 750 muskets, shotguns, and rifles, receiving and repairing ordnance supplies, carrying out guard, office, and police responsibilities, and inspecting posts in Camden and Arkadelphia.",
        "Until November 1862, Lt. Col. Dunnington oversaw the construction of his projects in Little Rock. At that time, Captain Sanford C. Faulkner, known for composing The Arkansas Traveler, took over the Arsenal. It is assumed that Dunnington then resumed his naval responsibilities on the Ponchartrain.",
        "A report titled \" Summary of Activities in November 1862 at Little Rock Arsenal \" indicates: Production:",
        "Seventy-five thousand cartridges loaded with buckshot and a single large ball - percussion ignition.",
        "14,000 cartridges loaded with buckshot and a single ball - flintlock.",
        "Two hundred and seventy-five paper fuses",
        "117 rounds of ammunition, consisting of 6-pounder canister shot.",
        "130 shots fired using 6-pound cannonballs.",
        "Boxes containing 96 units of ammunition",
        "Fixed:",
        "2,236 shotguns and rifles, primarily refurbished for use by military personnel.",
        "23 handguns, primarily repaired for soldiers on active duty.",
        "Items received and items issued:",
        "A total of 752 packages containing ordnance and ordnance supplies were received and predominantly distributed to active-duty troops.",
        "Fixed and coated:",
        "Four wheeled vehicles for transporting guns",
        "Executed:",
        "Security, administrative, and law enforcement responsibilities.",
        "The key highlights from the \"Summary of Work\" above and the subsequent months are that the primary ammunition produced was \"buck & ball,\" revealing that the prevalent firearms in use were .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns. Additionally, around one-sixth or more of the total small arms ammunition was designated for flintlock weapons, suggesting that at least a sixth of the Confederate soldiers in the area still carried outdated flintlock firearms.",
        "The records detailing the work accomplished at Little Rock Arsenal under the C.S.A. maintained a consistent pace and volume between August 1862 and August 1863. The report for August 1863 includes a foreboding entry stating that towards the end of the month, most of the supplies at the Arsenal were packed and dispatched to Arkadelphia as per the orders of the Chief of Ordnance, District of Arkansas. This event signifies the commencement of relocating ordnance operations from Little Rock, which eventually led to the city's surrender to the advancing Federal forces of Frederick Steele's Arkansas Expedition on September 11, 1863.",
        "In 1864, following the Union Army's recapture of Little Rock and the arsenal, General Fredrick Steele led 8,500 troops from the arsenal to initiate the Camden Expedition.",
        "The arsenal was temporarily taken over again by supporters of Joseph Brooks amid the Brooks-Baxter conflict in 1874.",
        "In 1873, the structure underwent a name change to Little Rock Barracks and was repurposed to accommodate married officers and their families. Significant modifications were made to both the interior and exterior of the building. Originally, access was limited to a rear basement door, and a tower was utilized for moving munitions between levels. By 1868, enhancements such as front and rear porches, interior walls, and stairs were introduced, with some elements like the central staircase still existing today. It was in 1880 when Douglas MacArthur, the son of Captain Arthur MacArthur, was born on the northwest upper floor of this building during his father's military posting there.",
        "During the 1880s, the federal government initiated the closure of numerous small arsenals nationwide in favor of constructing smaller ones in proximity to railroads for swift deployment. The arsenal commander at the Little Rock site was informed from Washington that it must be vacated by October 1, 1890. Subsequently, on April 12, 1893, the tower building and adjacent structures were exchanged with the city of Little Rock for 1,000 acres (4 km²) in North Little Rock, with the condition that the land and building be exclusively designated for public park use. The swapped land was situated in Big Rock Mountain on the north side of the Arkansas River, which is now known as North Little Rock. This location was later developed into Fort Logan H. Roots, and all original buildings surrounding the Tower Building were subsequently demolished.",
        "In 1894, the Tower Building became the new home of the Little Rock Æsthetic Club, one of the oldest women's societies west of the Mississippi River. The relocation was driven by a growing membership and the necessity for larger, more permanent meeting spaces. The previous year, club members collaborated with women's organizations statewide to fund the furnishing of the Arkansas Building at the Columbian Exposition in The Chicago World's Fair. Following the fair, items from the exhibition were showcased in the Tower Building, where the Æsthetic Club convened in the designated \"Columbian Room.\"",
        "With the exception of gatherings held by the Æsthetic Club, the Tower Building stood vacant for nearly five decades and experienced considerable decay. The Æsthetic Club played a crucial role in offering financial assistance during this time, covering the electricity expenses even throughout the challenging period of the Great Depression. To this day, the Æsthetic Club continues to operate from its headquarters situated in the Tower Building.",
        "Throughout the early 20th century, the building and the adjacent park were utilized for various public purposes. Specifically, the Tower Building functioned as the headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion from May 15 to 18, 1911. This event attracted over 106,000 Civil War veterans, marking the largest popular gathering in the city's history at that time. The veterans were accommodated in the building or camped in the park, which had transformed into a favored camping spot. Subsequently, the Tower Building was repurposed as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the second floor of the Tower Building was repurposed as Little Rock's inaugural public library. Additionally, a fire station was erected in the park in 1917, although it has since been demolished. A band shell, named after H. H. Foster, was also constructed in the park during this period but no longer stands. In 1936, the Works Progress Administration constructed the Museum of Fine Arts, now known as the Arkansas Arts Center, just south of the Tower Building.",
        "In 1970, the arsenal was officially recognized and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its connection to the Camden Expedition of 1864 makes it eligible for potential inclusion in the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark, which was established in 1994.",
        "In 1942, the Tower Building underwent renovations with support from the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It was transformed into the new location for The Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, previously housed in Little Rock City Hall. The museum remained in the Tower Building for around fifty-five years. The area surrounding the building, formerly known as Arsenal Park and later renamed City Park, was officially renamed MacArthur Park in 1942 to honor Douglas MacArthur, thanks to the efforts of Bernie Babcock.",
        "The Museum of Science and Natural History combined with the Little Rock Children's Museum in 1997 to create the Arkansas Museum of Discovery, relocating to a historic building in the Little Rock River Market District. The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History was established on May 19, 2001, in the Tower Building. Its mission is to educate visitors about Arkansas' military history, safeguard the Tower Building, pay tribute to American service members, and recognize the birth site of Douglas MacArthur.",
        "Cicely Mary Barker (28 June 1895 – 16 February 1973) was a renowned English illustrator celebrated for her enchanting illustrations of fairies and flowers. Barker's artistic journey commenced during her youth through distance learning and formal training at the Croydon School of Art. She ventured into the professional realm by creating greeting cards and illustrations for children's magazines. In 1923, she achieved a milestone with the publication of her inaugural book, Flower Fairies of the Spring, marking the beginning of a series of similar publications in the ensuing years.",
        "Barker, a committed Anglican, generously contributed her artwork to support Christian causes and missions. She created several Christian-themed publications like The Children's Book of Hymns and, in partnership with her sister Dorothy, He Leadeth Me. Additionally, she crafted a stained glass window for St. Edmund's Church in Pitlake and her painting of the Christ Child titled The Darling of the World Has Come was acquired by Queen Mary.",
        "Barker was skilled in various mediums such as watercolor, pen and ink, oils, and pastels. Her work was mainly influenced by Kate Greenaway and the Pre-Raphaelites. She preferred to paint based on instinct rather than following artistic doctrines. Barker passed away in 1973. While she had previously published Flower Fairy books centered around spring, summer, and autumn, a collection based on winter was not released until 1985, compiled from her unpublished works and published posthumously.",
        "Barker, the second daughter and youngest child of Walter Barker, a partner in a seed supply company and an amateur artist, and his wife Mary Eleanor (Oswald) Barker, was born on 28 June 1895 at their residence on 66 Waddon Road in Croydon, Surrey, England. She suffered from epilepsy during her childhood and received dedicated care from her parents initially, and later from her older sister Dorothy Oswald Barker, who was two years her senior.",
        "The family of four was comfortably situated within the upper middle class bracket. They employed a nanny, governess, and a cook to cater to Barker's specific dietary needs. Barker, who spent a significant amount of time in bed, entertained herself at home with painting books and a nursery library stocked with the creations of Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott, both of whom significantly impacted her future artistic endeavors.",
        "Barker engaged in art correspondence studies, likely until around 1919. At the age of 13 in 1908, she enrolled in an evening program at the Croydon School of Art and continued her studies there through the 1940s. Eventually, she secured a teaching role at the school.",
        "In 1911, Raphael Tuck & Sons purchased four of Barker's \"little drawings\" for half a sovereign and released them as postcards. By October 1911, she secured the second prize in the Croydon Art Society's poster contest and was soon after appointed as the youngest member of the Society. The art critic from the Croydon Advertiser noted, \"Her sketches display an extraordinary sense of liberation. She exhibits clear potential.\"",
        "After her father passed away in June 1912, the seventeen-year-old Barker contributed her art and poetry to various publications such as My Magazine, Child’s Own, Leading Strings, and Raphael Tuck annuals to help provide for her mother and sister. Dorothy, her sister, worked as a kindergarten teacher at two private schools and later established a home-based kindergarten, which not only generated income for the family but also involved managing household responsibilities.",
        "Fairies gained widespread popularity in art and literature during the early 20th century after the publications of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Coming of the Fairies, J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, and the fairy-themed creations of Australian artist Ida Rentoul Outhwaite. Queen Mary further popularized these themes by sending Outhwaite's postcards to her friends in the 1920s. Additionally, in 1918, Barker developed a series of postcards featuring elves and fairies.",
        "In 1923, Barker submitted her illustrations of flower fairies to multiple publishers. Blackie purchased 24 paintings along with verses for £25. However, Barker did not start receiving royalties for her work until the release of Flower Fairies of the Summer in 1925. In April of the same year, Mary Violet Clayton Calthrop, the wife of author Dion Clayton Calthrop, praised Barker's work on Flower Fairies of the Spring, noting her exquisite taste and drawing skills.",
        "In 1924, the family relocated to a four-story, semi-detached Victorian residence at 23 The Waldrons. Barker had a studio constructed in the garden, while her sister ran a kindergarten in a room at the rear of the house. The family practiced frugal living and frequented St. Edmund's and St. Andrew's in Croydon, which were considered \"low\" churches catering to the less affluent. Barker occasionally included depictions of her fellow church members in her religious artworks. Canon Ingram Hill referred to her as a key figure at St. Andrew's church.",
        "The children from the kindergarten posed as models for the Flower Fairies until its closure in 1940. In a 1958 interview, Barker mentioned, \"I utilized my sister's kindergarten students as models. I was surrounded by children for many years, an experience I cherished.\" Besides, she depicted the children of her relatives and even Gladys Tidy, the Barkers' young housekeeper, who inspired the Primrose Fairy in 1923. Barker meticulously painted the plants from real-life specimens, occasionally seeking assistance from Kew Gardens for specific samples. She personally crafted and tailored the Flower Fairy outfits, drawing inspiration from the flowers and leaves corresponding to each illustration. These costumes, stored in her studio trunk alongside twig and gauze wings, were disassembled after each use, with parts repurposed for new designs. Barker frequently consulted Dion Clayton Calthrop's English Costume for reference.",
        "By the late 1920s, Barker started questioning whether her efforts for the church were sufficient and contemplated dedicating herself entirely to religious compositions. Encouraged by her family and friends, she opted to pursue both sacred and secular music endeavors.",
        "Barker persevered with her evening studies at the Croydon Art School from the 1920s through the 1940s, leading to a role as a teacher. She embarked on sketching expeditions to Amberley, Storrington in Sussex, Cornwall, and the southern coast in the company of loved ones. Furthermore, she made visits to Gomshall, Surrey, where she stayed with the artist Margaret Tarrant, and to Ugglebarnby near Whitby, North Yorkshire, to spend time with her family.",
        "In 1940, after their live-in maid retired, the Barker family's routine changed. Dorothy Barker shut down her school located at the rear of their residence on The Waldrons but took on the responsibility of overseeing the household affairs and providing care for both her mother and sister. Dorothy and her sister collaborated on the creation of two books together: \"Our Darling's First Book\" and the Christian-themed \"He Leadeth Me.\" Unfortunately, Dorothy passed away in 1954 due to a heart attack. Subsequently, Barker found it challenging to dedicate time to her artistic pursuits following her sister's demise, as she had to take on the sole responsibility of looking after her elderly mother. Nevertheless, she did initiate the conceptualization of a stained glass window design in memory of her sister for St. Edmund's in Pitlake.",
        "After Barker's mother passed away in 1960, she relocated from 23 The Waldrons to 6 Duppas Avenue in Croydon in 1961. She renovated a maisonette in Storrington, Sussex, England, gifted to her by Edith Major, and called it St. Andrew's. Following her move, her health started to decline, requiring frequent stays in nursing and recovery facilities, where she received care from loved ones and companions.",
        "Barker passed away at the age of 77 on 16 February 1973 at Worthing Hospital. Following her death, two separate funeral services took place, one at Storrington Church and another at her maisonette. Her remains were laid to rest in Storrington churchyard. In 1989, Frederick Warne, which has been a part of Penguin Books since 1983, obtained ownership of the Flower Fairies properties.",
        "Barker primarily used watercolor combined with pen and ink for her artwork, but she also demonstrated proficiency in black-and-white illustrations, oils, and pastels. She always had a sketchbook handy to portray captivating children. In expressing her artistic approach, she mentioned, \"I have consistently aimed to paint in a spontaneous manner that feels innate to me, without much consideration for artistic principles.\"",
        "Kate Greenaway was a significant influence on Barker's art, as she admired Greenaway since her childhood. Barker's depictions of children in clothing reminiscent of Greenaway's designs, although less somber and with more depth, possibly due to technological advancements in printing. Barker had a keen eye for studying flowers and was close friends with fellow children's illustrator Margaret Tarrant. In addition to Greenaway, Barker drew inspiration from the works of illustrator Alice B. Woodward.",
        "Barker acknowledged a significant and enduring impact from the Pre-Raphaelites. She mentioned being influenced by them, particularly in terms of subject matter, and the emotions and ambience they were able to convey, rather than their techniques. She expressed an admiration for the early works of John Everett Millais and the exceptional art of Edward Burne-Jones.",
        "Barker distributed her sketches, drawings, and paintings of children as gifts to friends, families of the children, charitable organizations, and church events. Her works were also showcased by various art groups. Additionally, she provided illustrations for magazine covers, dust jackets, and created postcard series for publishers like Raphael Tuck. Some of her notable works include \"Picturesque Children of the Allies\" (1915), \"Seaside Holidays\" (1918), and \"Shakespeare's Boy and Girl Characters\" (1917, 1920). Her original books \"Old Rhymes for All Times\" (1928) and \"The Lord of the Rushie River\" (1938) received positive critical reception. \"Groundsel and Necklaces\" (1943) narrates the story of Jenny, who, through the help of fairies, lifts her family out of poverty in a setting around 1800, featuring a character akin to Dickens' Scrooge. \"Simon the Swan,\" conceived as a follow-up to Rushie River in 1943 but fully developed in 1953, was posthumously published in 1988 and is considered less successful than Groundsel.",
        "Barker, a dedicated Christian, created religious-themed artworks throughout her lifetime. She crafted eight postcards and five guardian angel birthday cards for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in 1916 and 1923, respectively. Over a span of 20 years, she designed Christmas cards for The Girls' Friendly Society, with the initial three designs selling a total of 46,500 copies in 1923. Queen Mary acquired an original design titled \"The Darling of the World Has Come\" for ₤5.50 in 1926. Additionally, the Croydon Art Society displayed Barker's booklet cover design for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at its November 1919 exhibition.",
        "Religious-themed publications by the artist include The Children's Book of Hymns (1929) and He Leadeth Me (1933), the latter of which was a collaborative effort with her sister. Notable religious artworks consist of the oil triptychs, The Feeding of the Five Thousand (1929), created for the chapel in Llandaff House in Penarth, Wales, and The Parable of the Great Supper (1934) for St. George's Chapel in Waddon. Although The Feeding piece is no longer extant, a black-and-white photograph from 1929 serves as a reproduction of the original. In 1941, she finished oil panels illustrating the seven sacraments for the baptismal font at St. Andrew's in South Croydon. The artist also designed baptismal rolls for the wall behind the font in 1948 and 1962. In 1946, she completed a 4 x 7 ft. oil painting titled Out of Great Tribulation for the Memorial Chapel at Norbury Methodist Church. After her sister's passing in 1954, the artist commenced work on a design for a stained glass memorial window portraying Christ about to wash his disciples' feet. This final religious-themed creation was installed in St. Edmund's in Pitlake in 1962.",
